This article is written with help from the artist Emily Lu, who specialises in Digital Culture & works at TATE. I couldn't have written this without our many 5+ hour conversations about digital culture. 

This article features both discussions in digital culture & digital anthropology.

# What is Digital Culture?

Culture is defined as:

> The arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively.

Digital Culture is about the digital human achievement.

Digital Anthrolpology is about the relationships between humans and electronical devices.

Our culture and the way we interact with every day things has changed so rapidly in the last 30 years. But because of the rapid change, we haven't really *planned* anything. And some of the questions we have or the interactions we have could be better if the rapid development of technology was slower.

By reading this, I hope to make you aware of your own connection with technology, of digital culture, and building technology that has a healthy relationship with humans and good culture. 

Our phones are our second heart

Second brain idea

When we die, will we really die? Can we live on in AI?

Is that AI us?

Is an AI that imitates human a human?

If we create an AI to create art, is that art our art? Or does it belong to the AI? What is art? (with emotions), can AI ever truly make art? 

What if the art is the algorithm we make?

Information overload

- How do we chooes to relive memories with information overload?

The right to be forgotten, or why we'll never be forgot

Calming things down, no commentary gameplay
