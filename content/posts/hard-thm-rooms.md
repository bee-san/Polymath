This is a community created path of extremely difficult rooms that will challenge you. While TryHackMe focuses on learning, the experts need to learn to and that requires much harder content.

Enjoy! If you manage to complete this entire list, please message the Discord about it â€“ it's **very hard!**

Some of these rooms have 2 - 3 solves, and some of them have been around for 2 years with only ~9 solves! Really, **good luck**!
