Hey!!!
So the short answer is, I don't really take notes (although sometimes I do)
With the internet, I don't believe that taking notes from a book is very useful in most cases.

What Â you want to develop is _assioicative_ knowledge. For example, you know Â that in the book Four Hour Body Tim Ferris talks about how to lose Â weight for martial arts competitions, but you don't remember exactly Â what he said.

This is perfect!!! You can just Google it. Or Â re-read that book. When reading books, you don't want to make your Â knowledge deep. You want it to be shallow and spread over everything. Â For example, if I wanted to know about the best way to evaluate a Â company using their managerial team, I know that this is a chapter in Â the intelligent investor. Although I have no idea where, and I don't Â remember a part of it!

With the internet, we get this really cool effect where you don't need to know the specifics of anything.

There's Â this story of a famous American businessman. People claimed he was the Â smartest man in the world, because he was so incredibly rich.

One day, a news reporter goes to debunk this. They ask him:
"How many gallons of Oil does the USA buy every year?"

The Â businessman presses a button on his desk. He's connected to an expert Â on oil economics in the USA. He answers "1.28 billion a year"

The Â newsreporter remarks "calling someone up and asking them the question Â clearly doesn't make you the smartest man in the world"

The bussinessman replied:
"No, Â what does make me the smartest person in the world is knowing that I Â know nothing. Having friends that do know things. And being able to talk Â to them to find out the answers of any question I may have"

The Â moral of the story is that you don't need to go deep for information in Â books. Just like how that businessman had a speed dial of people, we Â have the internet. (PS: you bet I got this from a book ðŸ˜›)

So, read as much as you want, as fast as you can. You don't need to remember it. 

Another Â thing, books are strange. I've just read Thinking Fast and Slow. I Â can't recount any one single experience of the book, but I know the Â whole picture. Biases are everywhere and we must know this. 

When Â you read books, you don't really come away with information, you come Â away with experience. The best people in the world who have worked in Â that field for 20, 40 years are distilling all the information down so Â you can learn it in a few days. 

If I'm ever designing a lesson plan for psychology students. I know there's a chapter about it in this book.

When you read, you come away with life experience, life lessons. There's a nice article on this:
[https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/its-okay-to-forget-what-you-read-f4ef1c34cc01](https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/its-okay-to-forget-what-you-read-f4ef1c34cc01)

Okay, Â so when do I take notes? If I'm reading something and I think "hey, Â this information is useful to my life right now. I need to remember it, Â so I'm going to write it down".

Actually, I don't exactly write Â it down. I ignore the page and try to write what I just read. Often Â times, I'll forget most of it. This is fine. I'm implementing active Â recall here. The same principle is used in flashcards to help you Â remember things. 

This helps me remember it for longer, and it only takes a couple of seconds so it's worth it :)

I don't try to write everything down. 

I have a private blog post on my blog where I write down all the things I read in books. I used to do it in my notes app :) 

I prefer digital storage because I can crtl + f to find it on the page, if I remember a part of it.

So, in summary, I:
1. Â Don't aim to memorise books at all. I aim to create shallow water that Â strecthes out far, because If I need to remember the specifics of Â something I can just Google it.
2. When I do find something that is Â directly useful to me, I write it down in some digital notebook so I can Â find it. When I'm bored, I'll read through it.

I don't use flashcards, because that's a habit and I'm bad at making habits as it is. 

If you're using a Kindle, you can use Readwise (paid service, not affiliate).
[readwise.io](http://readwise.io)
They Â email you daily of some cool Kindle highlights. They also have Â flashcards and stuff. I'm not paying for them, they send me some Â highlights every couple weeks to try and make me pay.

Although 2 really important tips for generally reading books:
1. Skip the parts you find boring. You don't have to read from A to Z.
2. Â Rereading a good book again is 100x more effective than reading a new Â book (this plays into memorising things. Once you've read a book a few Â times, you'll know a lot about it)

Hope this helps!!! :)
