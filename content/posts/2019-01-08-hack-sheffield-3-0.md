The train ride there is always the least fun part. Having to wake up at 5am to get a 6am train just to be on time!

This is an important step in any hackathon, deciding upon the API’s to use and what soft of application you want to create.

Our application aggregated data from SkyBets to allow the user to input the amount of money they would like to gamble and for our application to choose safe bets to automatically generate the user money. On top of this, the application used the profits earnt from SkyBets to find flights from the users home city at the cheapest possible prices, essentially safely gambling your way to free holidays.

Created using Node.js, Python, Angular, Shell Script, AWS, Docker, SkyScanner API and manually scraping the SkyBets Itallian website with Requests and Beautiful soup.

It’s tradition to run a game of Warewolves at hackathons in the UK, this game was simply amazing being run by the Github education team!

Midnight pizza is an essential part of any hackathon! At around this time we finished the SkyBets side of our application and we were deploying an SSL website through AWS, unfortunately AWS was a bit iffy at the time but it worked!

Competition time! It was a science fair-esque judging ceremony were people came over to our table and we had to explain our app in 2 minutes!
