> *“The bee is more honored than other animals, not because she labors, but because she labors for others.”*

> *— St. John Chrysostom.*

A third of our crops rely on pollination from bees, 75% of fruit and vegetables need bees to pollinate them. If suddenly a third of our crops and 75% of fruit and vegetables disappear from the planet, we will struggle to maintain our global population and to provide food to our nation.

Some of the foods we will lose to the decline of honey bees are:

- Apples
- Almonds
- Blueberries
- Strawberries
- Tomatoes

Just to name but a few of the many foods we will lose.

[Since 2010, more than 45% of bees in the UK have died](http://sos-bees.org/situation/), a massive decline in the population of UK Honey Bees. There are many suspected causes as to why honey bees are dying. Pesticides, destruction of natural habitat and climate change are just a few of the many causes. Nevertheless honey bees are dying and we need to save them.

### How can we save them?

Buy organically farmed fruits and vegetables from your nearest farmers market. Insecticides and pesticides are cited as one of the biggest causes of bee decline, so switching to organically farmed foods and supporting the local farmers who work with nature and the seasons to grow their crops is the first step.

#### Plant bee friendly flowers and plants.

Try planting some Roses, Lavender, Rosemary, Hydrangea or some Hawthorne. [The British Beekeepers society has a list of all the plants that support the bee ecosystem](https://www.bbka.org.uk/files/library/pollen_&amp;_nectar_rich_plants_for_your_garden_by_season_june_2011_for_website_1310045511.pdf).

#### Set up a bee refreshment station in your garden.

This could be as simple as a dog-bowel with a few rocks in it to make sure it doesn’t fly away or a bowel full of marbles in your garden.

#### Feed any bees that appear to be dead or dying.

Most bees will have a lot of pollen attached to them and will have run out of energy to move, so they may appear dead. If this happens, feed a bee a small tea spoon of water / sugar to revive it.

#### Tell a friend!

Bees are dying at a rapid pace and we need them to live, by telling other people about the decline of bees society will eventually understand the impact the loss of bees will have and we will work as a society to save the bees.
