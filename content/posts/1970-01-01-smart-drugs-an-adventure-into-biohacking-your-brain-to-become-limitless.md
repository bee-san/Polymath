what is a nootropic

synthectic vs natural

Nootropics are drugs that increase cognitive enhancement with no side effects in healthy individuals. Nootropics are not medicine. Medicine brings you from sick to healthy while nootropics improve you when you're healthy.

One of the most famous examples of nootropics is the film *limitless. *The film starts off with a failing writer who's recently divorced, going to be made homeless, and no one wants his books. He takes a magic pill and turns his life around.

 The film Limtiless is about a magical see through pill which when taken allows you to do amazing things - such as remembering every single thing you've ever seen or heard and using your brain to its full capacity.

Smart drugs, nootropics, are all designed to get you into this limitless state. This state let's you achieve anything - without limits. 

While this magical pill may not exist, there are substances out there which have been medically proven to improve cognition. In this article, we're going to go on an adventure through the world of smart drugs. 

## Synthectic vs Natural Drugs

Synthectic drugs are drugs created in labs by scientists - made from man-made chemicals rather than natural ingredients (although can feature natural ingredients). Some famous examples are Ecstasy, LSD, and Modafilin.

Natural drugs are found in nature - not created in labs by scientists. They can be plants, mushrooms, or even parts of an animal. Normally, natural drugs are found in plants or mushrooms.

Synthectic drugs can be just as safe as natural drugs - although their long-term effects aren't properly understood. Drugs such as modafilin have only existed since the 1970s at best whereas natural drugs have existed for thousands, if not millions of years and have been used by humans for centuries. 

While the short-term effects of synthectic smart drugs such as Modafilin or Adderal are very well know, the idea that these drugs can increase cognition has been brought into questioning many times. 

In a recent [study](https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/smart-drug-modafinil-may-not-make-you-brainier/), researchers at the University of Cambridge and the University of Nottingham gave 64 healthy volunteers either modafinil or a placebo (a placebo is a sugar pill. The idea is that participants do not know whether they are taking modafilin or placebo) and asked them to complete a spoken language test. The people who took modafinil had slowed responses, and were no more accurate than the placebo. 

Researchers gave 64 healthy volunteers either modafinil or a placebo and asked them to complete a spoken language test. Contrary to the Telegraph’s headline, the people who took modafinil had slowed responses, and were no more accurate than the placebo (this claim seems based on a previous trial by one of the researchers).

Because the study was small, its effects still aren't widely known on a larger population. Because of how new synthectic drugs are and how unknown their effects are (as well as if there is any bad side effects), many people choose to use natural drugs over synthectic drugs.

[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qvvg8q/i-tested-the-internets-five-favourite-nootropics](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qvvg8q/i-tested-the-internets-five-favourite-nootropics)

Natural drugs can very commonly be found in the ground around the world. Whether its tea leaves, sunlight, or mushrooms. 

Let's take a look at our first drug, caffine. 

## Caffine

The most popular and well known nootropic drugs. You'll often find people chugging coffee to get a hit of caffine. Caffine seems to consistently increase alrtness and attention, but whether these effects go away with regular use is still a matter of debate. 

Caffines side effects are often anxiety, mania, nauesea and headaches. The minimum lethal dose (the lowest dose required to kill you) can be found a few grams for some people. Because of this, it's not advisable to consistently consume caffine on a daily basis. Taking caffine over a long period of time consistently might worsen the good effects that it brings. By limiting the dosage, you can't get used to the effect of it and the effect is still as poignant as it was on day 1.

In the nootropic world it's very common to consume drugs via powders or pills. Coffee contains many things that could effect your body (milk, as an example). By taking pure caffine, you get all the benefits of it minus all the downsides to taking caffine through drinks or food.

Caffeine exerts its effects by blocking adenosine receptors A1 and A2A. [[120]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049999) The effects from the blockade of A1 receptors seems to deminish with  chronic exposure, but there may be residual effects that are mediated  through A2A receptors. [[121]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12700682)

Routine moderate caffine consumption has been assiocated with a decreased risk of parkinson's disease, alzheimers disease, depression, cardiovascular disease and strokes. [[122]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16443894)[[123]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182023)[[124]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182054)[[125]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221216)[[126]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949167)[[127]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24201300)

Interestingly, in one study there seemed to be a relationship between  extroverted personalities, caffeine intake and enhanced performance on  challenging working memory tasks.[[128]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20816912)

Long-term usage of caffine has been shown to sow hippocampus-depednent learning (hippocampus being the regeion which regulates emotions and spatial navigation) and impair long-term memory[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400186](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400186)]

You may be thinking "if caffine has bad side effects, why is it considered a nootropic?". Caffines long-term side effects can be mitigated by reducing the regular dosage of it. The short term effects can be mitigated by using another drug commonly found in green tea. This leads us onto our next top, stacks.

## Stacks

Stacks are combinations of drugs that work well together. This is common in the professional medical world as the nootropic world. There are many ways to stack medicines together, but uncertainty increases when stacking multiple compounds.

Medicines which on their own are fine to take can become dangerous when stacking. The uncertainties are even greater with children and young adults,  since brains aren't considered mature until about the age of twenty  five.[[140]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026746/?report=classic) It's generally recommended for children and young adults to focus on  getting enough sleep, exercising and maintaining a healthy  nutrient-dense diet.

Stacking creates a synergy where the whole is greater than the parts. The medicines on their own are okay, but when taken in a stack with great synergy you'll get more benefits and less side-effects than taking a drug on its own.

The easiest way to stack drugs together is to take drugs which have no side effects together. This minimises the risk of multiple bad side effects while attempting to maximise the upside of taking multiple drugs.

Although, be careful. Multiple drugs together may cause sevre side effects, so its wise to listen to your body and pay attention.

Another method for stacking drugs is to take a drug with no side effects which counteracts a drug with side effects. With caffine, the main side effect is anxiety. You can counteract the anxiety side effect by taking L-theanie.

### L-theanie

L-theanine is one of the main compounds found in green tea, and it has been shown to mitigate the side effects of caffine such as diminished sleep quality and anxiety, while possibly improving upon the positive aspects..[[83]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22214254)[[84]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15378679)[[85]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16930802)[[223]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869148)  Its ability to enhance attention has been repeatedly verified.[[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988)[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208)[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079786)[[9]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641209)[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040626)[[11]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22326943)[[223]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869148)

By stacking caffine & L-theanine together you get all the benefits with minimal downsides. Compare this to taking caffine on its own - where you get side effects. The combination of L-Theanine and caffine appears to improve attention mroe than caffine alone. [[6]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988)[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006208)

L-Theanine and Caffine are one of the most popular and safe stacks to take. L-Theanine does not seem to build tolerance, but caffine does. Caffine can also be addictive if taken too much. It's highly reccomended to take the combination of caffine and L-Theanine at irregular intervals (a few times a week at most) but to carry on taking L-Theanine, as it has no bad side effects and does not build tolerance.

L-theanine is a mild anxiety reducer. For many people L-theanine will  provide adequate anxiety reduction and relaxation. But for people with  severe anxiety it's unlikely to be enough on its own. For more serious  anxiety issues [ashwaganda](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/wiki/beginners#wiki_ashwagandha) will probably be a better fit.

The L-theanine to Caffine ratio should be kept at 1:2. That is, for every 1 MG of L-theanine you put into a drink, you should put 2mg in as well.

## Experimenting with yourself

The most effective way to make drugs effective is to find out how your body works, and the only way to do that would be to experiment with yourself. Start taking one drug at caffine at a dosage you choose (although for caffine it's reccomended 100mg if you don't regularly take caffine). Write down the dates you started and the dosage along with any notes.

Feel anxious? Your hands won't stop shaking? Good, write those down. Now you         know the point at which caffine starts to effect you. Next, start taking another drug to counteract this such as L-theanine and document your results. 

Remember to take in the idea of the problem of internal validty vs external validty. As an example, alcohol makes me sad and depressed. I could run this experiment 100s of times and I'll still get the same results. This is internal validity. But does that prove that alcohol makes everyone sad and depressed? No, for a lot of people it has the opposite effect. 

My experiment might have tremendous internal validty and zero external validty, but does it matter? Yes, and no. Yes, it matters because you're experimenting with yourself. But no, just because it works for you doesn't mean it'll work for me. Bare in mind that any opinionated things you read online about drugs can also fall into this trap. Self-experimentation is the only way you'll know for sure if it works.

### Skeptical empiricism

When something is empirical, it is based on or verifable by an experiment or observation. 

Skeptical empiricism means to question theories and claims which aren't derived from verifiable experiments or observations. Instead of reading online about how great drug XYZ is, try to find some research that proves how great XYZ is. 

When researching nootropics you'll often find people claiming that the drug they are taking is the best thing in the entire world and everyone should take it. This is called [evangelising](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6NvbSwuSAooQxxf7f/beware-of-other-optimizing). They've spent years and years researching drugs and found one that works for them. Their internal validation is great, but the external validation might not be so great.

Now that we've seen how effective nootropics are, we're going to look at nootropics which have a high return of investment for most humans but with little to no up-expenditure of money. This is the low hanging fruit.

## Exercise

Exercise is a simple way to improve your ability to learn and focus. Healthy body = healthy mind. At school or work we spend many hours sitting down, so it is important to exercise.

Imagine a plant. The plant grows upwards, that is all. It does not neccesarily grow sideways or upside down. It just grows. Now, imagine a hamster.

Now this hamster needs to move around to survive. Move to its food, move to its water, move to have fun. There's an animal called a seasquirt who spends the first part of its life finding somewhere to nest. Once it has found where to nest, it stays there for life - never moving.

The seasquirt absorbs and consumes all that is needed for movement once it has found this location - including its brain. 

The neuroscientist (eye of a vortex from neurons to self)

> That which we call thinking is the evoluntary internalisation of movement

Brains are for creatures that move. If you don't use it, you lose it. Astronauts that spend a lot of time in orbit have a loss of bone density. On the whole, every part of your body is adapted to do specific things. If you're not doing them, your body redirects resources.

But you can't just turn things on and off. You need to do what your body is built to do in order to keep it all working. Exercise is a matter of working or not working. 

Neighborville illonois phil lawler

Physical education was always based on sport, so the few kids who were athletically gifted dominated the sports. Meaning, people who weren't athletically gifted ended up standing around most of the time. 

Lawler changed his classes from traditional sports to something like jogging, he graded his students on effort rather than skills. By the end of its first semester in 1990 his test group of students showed a 17% improvement in reading and comprehension compared to a 10.7% average improvment for the kids who didnt' participate. 

Regular exercise improves your brain in 3 different ways. It optimises the levels of neurotransmitters like *serotonin, norepinepherine, *and *dopamine*.

There are all cruical for learning. Exercise can help stimulate *neurogenesis *which is the birth of new neurons from neural stem cells in the hippocampus.

Exercise improves the ability to bind neurons together (BDNF).

In a study done at the University of British Columbia, researchers found  that regular aerobic exercise, the kind that gets your heart and your  sweat glands pumping, appears to boost the size of the hippocampus, the  brain area involved in verbal memory and learning. Resistance training,  balance and muscle toning exercises did not have the same results.                     

Exercise helps memory and thinking through both direct and indirect  means. The benefits of exercise come directly from its ability to reduce  insulin resistance, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the release of  growth factors—chemicals in the brain that affect the health of brain  cells, the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and even the  abundance and survival of new brain cells.

Indirectly, exercise improves mood and sleep, and reduces stress and  anxiety. Problems in these areas frequently cause or contribute to  cognitive impairment.

Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control  thinking and memory (the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal cortex)  have greater volume in people who exercise versus people who don’t.  “Even more exciting is the finding that engaging in a program of regular  exercise of moderate intensity over six months or a year is associated  with an increase in the volume of selected brain regions,” says Dr.  Scott McGinnis, a neurologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an  instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School.

So what should you do? Start exercising! We don’t know exactly which  exercise is best. Almost all of the research has looked at walking,  including the latest study. “It’s likely that other forms of aerobic  exercise that get your heart pumping might yield similar benefits,” says  Dr. McGinnis.

How much exercise is required to improve memory? These study  participants walked briskly for one hour, twice a week. That’s 120  minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. Standard recommendations  advise half an hour of moderate physical activity most days of the week,  or 150 minutes a week. If that seems daunting, start with a few minutes  a day, and increase the amount you exercise by five or 10 minutes every  week until you reach your goal.

If you don’t want to walk, consider other moderate-intensity  exercises, such as swimming, stair climbing, tennis, squash, or dancing.  Don’t forget that household activities can count as well, such as  intense floor mopping, raking leaves, or anything that gets your heart  pumping so much that you break out in a light sweat.

### More fruit and veg

This is the low hanging fruit section for a reason. Eating more fruit and vegetables has [shown ](http://n.neurology.org/content/92/1/e63?casa_token=x2m5BjtZgY8AAAAA%3ALDe1c-kBq-2AIw1dMZfnbJ2LErDDZYG4L1sSHAzY8_Mm3HCI4rhJNEnHRoZ-8OX5e2hu7rg7S2Jgu5ogo-8)to repeatedly [increase cognitive functionality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/) as well as being [repeatedly shown](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/) to decrease the risk of heart disease, cancer and more.

### Meditation

Meditation is a practice as old as time. 

The first benefit of adopting a meditation habit is that it physically changes your brain. A [study ](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sara_lazar/home)conducted by Sara Lazar at Harvard found that meditation improves upon 3 parts of the brain:

1. The left hippocampus, which is responsible for your ability to learn as well as your ability to retain information
2. Posterior cingulate cortex which gives you the ability to control how your mind wanders
3. Temporo Parietal Junction which is responsible for empathy and pasion.

Meditation reduces bad feelings. Meditation has [shown ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4142584/)to reduce anxiety and stress

Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators according to this [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281830322X).

Professor Willem Kuyken carried out [Research ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2517515) published in Jama Internal Medicine. Kuyken states that meditation and minfullness has helped people:

> "Just as much commonly prescribed anti-depressiant drugs".

People undergoing this study had a 31% less chance of relapsing depression.

Researchers of John Hopkins reviewed over 19,000 meditation studies in a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754) publishd in Jama Internal Medicine. They found that across all studies:

- Meditation decreases anxiety
- Meditation decreases depression

Meditation has shown to help overcome bad habits. [Research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5441879/)carried out by Bowen in 2014 showed that:

1. 8% of alcoholics who used mindfullness meditation relapsed after a year
2. 20% of alcoholics using a 12-step program relapsed after a year

Your ability to concentrate and focus is improved with meditating. In a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20483826) carried out in 2010 by Maclean they had subjects complete boring tasks such as looking for small differences in lines of text.

They found that meditators performed significantly better which is a sign that meditation increases your ability to concentrate.

Another [study ](http://www.washington.edu/news/2012/06/13/mindful-multitasking-meditation-first-can-calm-stress-aid-concentration/)conducted by the university of washington found that meditation increased the length of which workers were able to concentrate on a task.
