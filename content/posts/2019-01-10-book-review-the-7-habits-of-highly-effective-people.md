# P / pc

This is a balancing act. You are balancing p and PC. These two are:
• Production of desired results
• Production capability

A struggling farmer finds an egg made of pure gold in the nest of his  goose. He thinks it is some kind of joke, then gets it appraised and  discovers that the golden egg is for real. The goose lays one of those  golden eggs every day, which should be enough for the farmer to live a  great life. He indeed becomes rich because of those golden eggs.

But even though he is now rich, it is not enough for the farmer. He  wants more, and getting that once-a-day egg is not enough. So, convinced  that there must be a literal goldmine inside the goose, he kills it and  slices it up to get all the golden eggs at once time. Only thing is, he  finds out that there is no golden eggs inside the goose, and now that  he has killed the goose, he will not be getting anymore. So thanks to  greed, he killed the thing that made him rich.

We often want the rewards, the p .but if we only focus on p, and don’t focus on the capability we risk not getting p at all.

Let’s say you buy a car. You want the p of the car, to be able to get  around quickly and with freedom but you don’t want to maintain the car.  Eventually the car will die early due to no maintenance and you’ll lose  the ability to get around. If you balanced p with pc you’ll be able to  get P still.

With friendships, we expect gifts, someone to listen, love and  happiness. Maybe even for them to drive you to places. If you don’t work  on pc, work on that friendship and only care about what they can do for  you eventually you’ll lose that p and you’ll no longer have a friend.

This is the transcript of a radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of [Newfoundland](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Newfoundland_(island)) in October, 1995. Radio conversation released by the [Chief of Naval Operations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chief_of_Naval_Operations) 10-10-95.

Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.Americans: This is the aircraft carrier *[USS Lincoln](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USS_Abraham_Lincoln_(CVN-72))*, the second largest ship in the United States’ [Atlantic fleet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_States_Fleet_Forces_Command).  We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous  support vessels. I demand that YOU change your course 15 degrees north,  that’s one five degrees north, or countermeasures will be undertaken to  ensure the safety of this ship.Canadians: This is a [lighthouse](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_lighthouses_in_Newfoundland_and_Labrador). Your call.

The navy captain was so caught up in his thinking that everything  should move for him, he didn’t see the bigger picture and realise that  light houses existed. It’s important to understand that our thinking  could fall into these traps ourselves.

“No one can hurt you without your consent”. Pain is either in the  past or in the future, it’s not in the present. It’s either happened, or  it’s going to happen.

We need to create principles, a personal manifesto for ourselves. By  centering our lives on fundamental principles we believe in we forgoe  the constant thinking that happens every day. We detect rather than  invent the fundamental principles in our lives.

He who is good with a hammer tends to think everything is a nail.

Imagine you are at a funeral. You go up to the casket. It’s your  funeral. What do you want your friends to say about you? Think about  this, because that is your manifesto.

What one thing could you do now, that if you did on a regular basis,  will improve your life dramatically? Do this, now. On a regular basis.

Effective people don’t worry about things that are not important. We  work on non-urgent important things in order to reduce how many urgent  problems we have. If you want to get something done, give it to a busy  man.

The key is to not prioritise what’s on your schedule but to schedule your priotories.

Effective people stay out of quadrants 3 and 4, because urgent or not; they are not impoirtant.

Effective people are not problem minded, they are opportunity minded.  quadrant 2 activities are non urgent but important things. they have  the biggest effect on your life in the long term, even though you may  not see the results right now.

You have to be proactive to work on quadrant 2. quadrants 1 and 3  work on you, they are urgency. if you work more on quadrant 2, you’ll  end up with less in quadrant 1.

If you want to get something done, give it to a busy man.

You can’t talk your way out of problems you behaved yourself into.

Imagine an emotional bank accoumt. You have an emotional bank account  with everyone you meet. We make deposits into it by listening and being  a good friend. We make withdrawels by being a bad friend.

The casue of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted inconflicting or ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.
