# Old Room
Shodan.io is a search engine for the Internet of Things.

Ever wondered how you can find publicly accessible CCTV cameras? What about finding out how many Pi-Holes are publicly accessible?

Or whether your office coffee machine is on the internet?

Shodan.io is the answer!

Shodan scans the whole internet and indexes the services run on each IP address. 

Note: if you are following along, you'll need a premium Shodan account.

### Finding services 

Let's say we are performing a pentest on a company, and we want to find out what services one of their servers run. 

We need to grab their IP address. We can do this using `ping`.

We can ping tryhackme.com and the ping response will tell us their IP address.

```
Pinging tryhackme.com [142.93.194.248] with 32 bytes of data:
```

Then once we do this, we put the IP address into Shodan to get:

We can see that TryHackMe runs on Cloudflare in the United States and they have many ports open.

Cloudflare acts as a proxy between TryHackMe and their real servers. If we were pentesting a large company, this isn't helpful. We need some way to get their IP addresses.

We can do this using Autonomous System Numbers.

### Autonomous System Numbers
An autonomous system number (ASN) is a global identifier of a range of IP addresses. If you are an enormous company like Google you will likely have your own ASN for all of the IP addresses you own.

We can put the IP address into an ASN lookup tool such as https://www.ultratools.com/tools/asnInfo ,

Which tells us they have the ASN AS14061.

Tryhackme isn't a mega large corporation, so they don't own their own ASN. When we google AS14061 we can see it is a DigitalOcean ASN number.

On Shodan.io, we can search using the ASN filter. The filter is `ASN:[number]` where number is the number we got from earlier, which is AS14061.

Doing this, we can see a whole range 6.2 million websites, in fact) that are on this one single ASN!

https://www.shodan.io/search?query=asn%3AAS14061

Knowing the ASN is helpful, because we can search Shodan for things such as coffee makers or vulnerable computers within our ASN, which we know (if we are a large company) is on our network. 


## Getting started
Time to dig in! If you get stuck, look at the previous task for some help! :)

### Banners

To get the most out of Shodan, it's important to understand the search query syntax.

Devices run services, and Shodan stores informatiion about them. The information is stored in a _banner_. It's the most fundamental part of Shodan.

An example banner looks like:

```json
{
    "data": "Moxa Nport Device
                Status: Authentication disabled
		            Name: NP5232I_4728
			                MAC: 00:90:e8:47:10:2d",
					    "ip_str": "46.252.132.235",
					        "port": 4800,
						    "org": "Starhub Mobile",
						    "location": {
						            "country_code": "SG"
							        
						    }
						    
}
```

# filters
On the Shodan.io homepage, we can click on "explore" to view the most up voted search queries. The most popular one is webcams.

https://www.shodan.io/explore

Note: this is a grey area. It is legal to view a publicly accessible webcam, it is illegal to try to break into a password protected one. Use your brain and research the laws of your country!

One of the other most up voted searches is a search for MYSQL databases.

https://www.shodan.io/search?query=product%3AMySQL

If we look at the search, we can see it is another filter.

product:MySQL

Knowing this, we can actually combine 2 searches into 1.

On TryHackMe's ASN, let's try to find some MYSQL servers. 

We use this search query

asn:AS14061 product:MySQL

And ta-da! We have MYSQL servers on the TryHackMe ASN (which is really the DigitalOcean ASN).

https://www.shodan.io/search?query=asn%3AAS14061+product%3AMySQL

Shodan has many powerful filters. My favourite one is the vuln filter, which let's us search for IP addresses vulnerable to an exploit.

Let's say we want to find IP addresses vulnerable to Eternal Blue:

vuln:ms17-010

However, this is only available for academic or business users, to prevent script kiddies from abusing this!

Here are some nice filters we can use on Shodan:

City
Country
Geo (coordinates)
Hostname
net (based on IP / CIDR)
os (find operating systems)
port
before/after (timeframes)

# API
Shodan.io has an API! It requires an account, so I won't talk about it here.

If you want to explore the Shodan API, I've written a blog post about finding Pi-Holes with it here:

https://github.com/beesecurity/How-I-Hacked-Your-Pi-Hole/blob/master/README.md

The API lets us programmatically search Shodan and receive a list of IP addresses in return. If we are a company, we can write a script to check over our IP addresses to see if any of them are vulnerable.

PS: You can automatically filter on Shodan by clicking the things in the left hand side bar!
