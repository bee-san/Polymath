When you were born, everyone assured you that you could do, have, and  be anything you wanted when you grew up. So, now that you’ve grown up,  are you doing, having, and being anything and everything you’ve ever  wanted? Or somewhere along the way, did you redefine ‘anything and  everything’ to include settling for less than you truly want?

Oprah was when she said, ‘The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.’

you must first dedicate time each day to becoming the person you need  to be, one who is qualified and capable of consistently attracting,  creating, and sustaining the levels of success you want.

‘Your level of success, will rarely exceed your level of personal  development, because success is something you attract by the person you  become,’

Our outer world will always be a reflection of our inner world. Our  level of success is always going to parallel our level of personal  development. Until we dedicate time each day to developing ourselves  into the person we need to be to create the life we want, success is  always going to be a struggle to attain.

‘If you want your life to be different, you have to be willing to do something different first!’

First, we must understand and acknowledge the reality that 95% of our  society will never create and live the life they really want. We must  embrace the fact that if we don’t commit to thinking and living  differently than most people now, we are setting ourselves up to endure a  life of mediocrity, struggle, failure and regret – just like most  people.

what’s possible when we commit to fulfilling our potential. Being  average means to settle for less than you truly want and are capable of,  and to struggle for your entire life.

We mistakenly believe that who we were is who we are,

Don’t place unnecessary limitations on what you want for your life.  Think bigger than you’ve allowed yourself to think up until this point.  Get clear on what you truly want, condition yourself to the belief that  it’s possible by focusing on and affirming it every day, and then  consistently move in the direction of your vision until it becomes your  reality.

There is nothing to fear, because you cannot fail – only learn, grow, and become better than you’ve ever been before.

Always remember that where you are is a result of who you were, but  where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be, from this moment  on.

I combined this with my other life purpose (yes, you can have more  than one), which was to selflessly add value to the lives of others by  assembling a team of 16 other sales reps. I led weekly conference  coaching calls to support them in reaching their goals, free of charge,  for the next 46 consecutive weeks. Living every day in alignment with my  two life purposes – constantly, consciously aligning my thoughts, words  and actions with each purpose – not only did I have my best sales year  ever (a 94% increase over my previous best),

Matthew Kelly enlightens us to a universal life purpose that I  believe we should all live by: to become the best version of ourselves.

Always remember that when you are committed to a life purpose that is  bigger than your problems, your problems become relatively  insignificant and you will overcome them with ease.

T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: ‘How you do anything is how you do everything.’

Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right  thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person who  does what’s easy, rather than what’s right.

‘Discipline creates lifestyle.’

For example, when the alarm clock goes off, and we hit the snooze  button (the easy thing), most people mistakenly assume that this action  is only affecting that moment. The reality is that this type of action  is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is  okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do  (more on that in the next chapter).

The link between success and accountability is irrefutable. Virtually  all highly successful people – from CEOs to professional athletes to  the President of the United States – embrace a high degree of  accountability.

Research has shown that we become like the average of the five people  we spend the most time with. Who you spend your time with may be the  single most determining factor in the person you become and in your  quality of life. If you are surrounded with lazy, weak-minded,  excuse-making people, you’ll inevitably become like them. Spend time  with positive, successful achievers and inevitably their attitudes and  successful habits will reflect on you. You’ll become more and more like  them.

•  You can join an online community such as Meetup.com, where you can  connect with like-minded people in your area who have similar  interests. You can join an existing Meetup group, or start your own.

Always seek people who will add value to your life and bring out the best in you. And of course, be that person for others.

Your entire life changes the day that you decide you will no longer accept mediocrity for yourself.

Many people who suffer from depression report that the morning time  is the most difficult. They wake up with dread. Sometimes it is because  of a job they feel obligated to go to, or due to a relationship that is  failing.

On the other hand, when you wake up each day with passion and  purpose, you join the small percentage of high achievers who are living  their dreams.

When are you going to develop yourself into the person you need to be  to create the levels of health, wealth, happiness, success and freedom  that you truly want and deserve? When are you going to actually live  your life instead of numbly going through the motions looking for every  possible distraction to escape reality? What if your reality – your life  – could finally be something that you can’t wait to be conscious for?

According to the National Sleep Foundation, some research has found  that long sleep durations (nine hours or more) are also associated with  increased morbidity (illness, accidents) and even mortality (death.)

So, the key is to consciously decide every night to actively and mindfully create a positive expectation for the next morning.

1    Set your intentions the night before: This is the most important  step. Remember: your first thought in the morning is usually the last  thought you had before bed, so take responsibility for creating genuine  excitement for the next morning, every night before bed. 2    Keep your  alarm clock across the room: Remember – movement creates energy!  3    Brush your teeth: Use a mouthwash for extra umph! 4    Drink a Full  Glass of Water: Hydrate yourself, ASAP. 5    Get in your workout  clothes: Earn your A.M. shower!

Success is something you attract by the person you become. Jim Rohn

Remember, when you change your inner world – your life – then your outer world – your life situation – will improve in parallel.

Study after study shows that meditation can be more effective than medication.

It’s the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief. Once that  belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen. Muhammad Ali

Henry Ford said, ‘Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right either way.’

We’ve all been programmed – at the subconscious level – to think,  believe, and act the way we do. Our programming is a result of many  influences, including what we have been told by others, what we have  told ourselves, and all of our life experiences – both good and bad.  Some of us have programming that makes it easy for us to be happy and  successful, while others – possibly the majority – have programming that  makes life difficult.

So, the bad news is that if we don’t actively change our programming,  our potential will be crushed and our lives limited by the fears,  insecurities, and limitations of our past.

You can use affirmations to start programming yourself to be  confident and successful in everything you do, simply by repeatedly  telling yourself who you want to be, what you want to accomplish, and  how you are going to accomplish it. With enough repetition, your  subconscious mind will begin to believe what you tell it, act upon it,  and eventually manifest it in your reality.

Step 1: What you really want The purpose of a written affirmation is  to program your mind with the beliefs, attitudes and behaviours/habits  that are vital to your being able to attract, create and to sustain your  ideal levels of success – Level 10 success – in every area of your  life. So, your affirmation must first clearly articulate exactly what  you want your ideal life to be like, in each area. You can organize your  affirmations according to the areas that you most want to focus on  improving, such as health/fitness, mindset, emotions, finances,  relationships, spirituality, etc. Begin with clarifying, in writing,  what you really want – your ideal vision for yourself and your life – in  each area.

As my good friend Adam Stock, President of Rising Stock, Inc. once  told me, ‘The wise begin with whys’. Everyone wants to be happy,  healthy, and successful, but wanting is rarely an effective strategy for  getting. Those who overcome the temptations of mediocrity and achieve  everything they want in life have an extraordinarily compelling why that  drives them. They have defined a clear life purpose that is more  powerful than the collective sum of their petty problems and the  countless obstacles they will inevitably face, and they wake up each day  and work towards their purpose.

Step 3: Who you are committed to being to create it As my first  coach, Jeff Sooey used to say, ‘This is where the rubber meets the  road’. In other words, your life gets better only after you get better.  Your outer world improves only after you’ve invested countless hours  improving yourself. Being (who you need to be) and doing (what you need  to do) are prerequisites for having what you want to have. Get clear on  who you need to be, are…

Step 4: What you’re committed to doing to attain it Which actions  will you need to take on a consistent basis to make your vision for your  ideal life a reality? Want to lose weight? Your affirmation might say  something like: I am 100% committed to going to the gym five days a week  and running on the treadmill for a minimum of 20 minutes. If you’re a  salesperson, your affirmation might read: I’m committed to making 20  prospecting calls every day, from 8am–9am. The more specific your  actions are, the better. Be sure to include frequency (how often),  quantity (how many), and precise time frames (what times you’ll begin  and end your activities.) It’s also important to start small. If you’re  going to the gym zero days a week for zero minutes, going to five days a  week for 20 minutes is a big leap. It’s important to take manageable  steps. Feel small successes along the way so you feel good and don’t get  discouraged by setting expectations too high to be able to maintain.  You can build up to your ideal…

I am always on the lookout for quotes and philosophies that I can add  to my affirmations. For example, one of my affirmations comes from the  book What Got You Here Won’t Get You There by Marshal Goldsmith. It  reads: ‘The #1 skill of influencers is the sincere effort to make a  person feel that he or she is the most important person in the world.  It’s one of the skills that Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and Bruce  Goodman used to become the best in their fields. I will do this for  every person I connect with!’ Another reads: ‘Follow Tim Ferris’ advice:  To maximize productivity, schedule 3–5 hour blocks or half-days of  singularly focused attention on ONE single activity or project, rather  than trying to switch tasks every 60 minutes.’ Any time you see or hear a  quote that inspires you, or come across an empowering philosophy or  strategy and think to yourself, man, that is a huge area of improvement…

order for your affirmations to be effective, it is important that you  tap into your emotions while reading them. Mindlessly repeating a  phrase over and over again, without feeling its truth, will have a  minimal impact on you. You must take responsibility for generating  authentic emotions and powerfully infusing those emotions into every  affirmation you repeat to yourself. Have fun with…

Ordinary people believe only in the possible. Extraordinary people  visualize not what is possible or probable, but rather what is  impossible. And by visualizing the impossible, they begin to see it as  possible. Cherie Carter-Scott

If you don’t make time for exercise, you’ll probably have to make time for illness. Robin Sharma

The only exercise most people get is jumping to conclusions, running  down their friends, sidestepping responsibility, and pushing their luck.  Unknown

recently saw an eye-opening video with personal development expert  and self-made multi-millionaire entrepreneur, Eben Pagan, who was being  interviewed by bestselling author Anthony Robbins. Tony asked, ‘Eben,  what is your #1 key to success?’ Of course, I was very encouraged when  Eben’s response was, ‘Start every morning off with a personal success  ritual. That is the most important key to success.’ Then he went on to  talk about the importance of morning exercise

Eben said, ‘Every morning, you’ve got to get your heart rate up and  get your blood flowing and fill your lungs with oxygen.’ He continued,  ‘Don’t just exercise at the end of the day or at the middle of the day.  And even if you do like to exercise at those times, always incorporate  at least 10 to 20 minutes of jumping jacks or some sort of aerobic  exercise in the morning.’

The benefits of morning exercise are too many to ignore. From waking  you up and enhancing your mental clarity, to helping you sustain higher  levels of energy throughout the day, exercising soon after rising can  improve your life in many ways.

The Miracle Morning (60-minute) sample schedule: Using the Life  S.A.V.E.R.S. •  Silence (5 minutes) •  Affirmations (5 minutes)  •  Visualization (5 minutes) •  Exercise (20 minutes) •  Reading (20  minutes) •  Scribing (5 minutes) Total time: 60 minutes

Keep in mind that digesting food is one of the most energy-draining  processes the body goes through each day. The bigger the meal, the more  food you give your body to digest, the more drained you will feel. With  that in mind, I recommend eating after your Miracle Morning. This  ensures that, for optimum alertness and focus during the Life  S.A.V.E.R.S., your blood will be flowing to your brain rather than to  your stomach to digest your food.

It’s been said that our quality of life is created by the quality of  our habits. If a person is living a successful life, then that person  simply has the habits in place that are creating and sustaining their  levels of success.

An extraordinary life is all about daily, continuous improvements in the areas that matter most. Robin Sharma

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Neale Donald Walsh

Every day, think as you wake up, ‘Today I am fortunate to have woken  up, I am alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste  it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my  heart out to others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.’  Dalai Lama
