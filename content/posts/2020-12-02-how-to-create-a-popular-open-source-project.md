I have around ~10k GitHub stars with my projects being featured at many conferences (most notably DefCon) and more. I developed a formula based on how one of my projects got popular, and it's worked everytime I've used it. But, some things you should know:
* I primarily make CLI projects. Frontend is different.
* I primarily make infosec projects

While I can't guarantee your project will succeed, these steps give it the greatest chance to.

## Well-designed Readme
Your project needs a well-designed readme. For CLI applications this is non-negotiable.

You should spend weeks designing your README. It has to be beautiful, eye catching, stunning.

Let's go through some key aspects of a good readme.

### Logo

The logo is the first things many people see. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you do need a logo. 

For distributing to other platforms, social share cards and more logos are important.

To easilly create a logo, go to [canva](https://canva.com) and search "logo". Pick one you like and change the name / subtext to match your brand.

You don't have to spend forever on this. I spend perhaps ~5 minutes at the start.

Of course, as the project grows a hand-made logo is better. But for now, a simple Canva logo is great!
