You want to do TryHackMe, but perhaps you do not want to pay for a subscription. This means you will not get access to paths, which are a guided series of rooms to take you from not knowing something to knowing something.

This blog post will detail a free path I have created for you, taking you from a beginner to a medium level. This blog post will stay continuously updated with new rooms as they come out and will improve with suggestions from the community.

This will be for an offensive pentesting path, but some rooms will feature blue teaming too. Red teaming is offensive, blue teaming is defensive.

Note: This is a community provided path for you featuring free rooms only. For the best experience, with a path made for you with premium rooms please subscribe.

Please scroll down to the end to get a Markdown version, so you can use this in your personal notes.

Note: If you have any concerns with these rooms or want to add more, DM on Discord or on Reddit. I'm Mod Bee ðŸ‘‹

# Introduction
This blog post is split into multiple levels, each one aiming to teach you one part. You can skip levels if you'd like, but they are all essential to a hackers mindset.

Rooms on TryHackMe are broken into two types:

* Walkthroughs

They walk you through the problem domain and teach you the skills required.

* Challenge (CTF)

You are given a machine and you have to hack into it, without any help.

You are allowed to look at walkthroughs for challenge CTFs, however, try to only read what is necessary if you get stuck. And only read the walkthrough if you are really stuck.

If you would like a hint without reading a walkthrough, you can ask on our Discord, Subreddit or Forums.

# Level 1 - Intro
The absolute bare minimum you should know before doing any CTFs.

OpenVPN https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn
Welcome https://tryhackme.com/jr/welcome
Intro to Researching https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoresearch
Learn Linux https://tryhackme.com/room/zthlinux
Crash Course Pentesting https://tryhackme.com/room/ccpentesting

Here are some introductory style capture the flag (challenge) like rooms to help you out. These are classed on the site as walkthroughs other than OHsint, however, they feature a lot of challenge

Google Dorking https://tryhackme.com/room/googledorking
OHsint https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint
Shodan.io https://tryhackme.com/room/shodan

# Level 2 - Tooling
The most important thing in a pentester's toolbox, tooling. This section aims to teach you the absolute minimum of neccesary tools to make you a better hacker.

# Conclusion
Now you will have a good understanding of hacking, all for free! You should now be able to do the easiest challenges quickly, and medium challenges are where you will now gain the most amount of knowledge.

If you got this far, consider subscribing to unlock even better rooms. Most Windows rooms are subscriber-only because Windows uses more resources than Linux. If you want to learn more Windows pentesting, a subscription is one of the better ways to go about it.

Thanks to CatchUpHackers for writing Zero to Hero, which inspired this article.

# What to do next?
Subscribe to TryHackMe to get paths featuring subscriber-only rooms. Trust me, they are far better than anything I could make!
New challenge rooms are released weekly, have a go at them before the writeups come out!
Keep a list of interesting CTFs and do them.
Sign up to other platforms such as CTF time and take part in competitive CTFs. You'll be surprised by how far you can get with the knowledge you have!
Start a blog with writeups of new rooms.
Create your own challenge rooms for TryHackMe.
Did you like reverse engineering? How about Windows? Or perhaps privesc? You can specialise in one area if you really like it. Just search for rooms with that on TryHackMe, or ask in the Discord/Forums/Sub-reddit "I liked X and want to do more".
