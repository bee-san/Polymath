Now done at a more healthy rate of "whenever I'm finished writing". Great, long articles about technological advancements and the future. From the future of farming to the future of education 🎓

# 📚 Free books

As a subscriber, you'll get access to everything I write - for free. Yeah I know I do that at the moment anyway... But in the future, it'll just be for you 😁

# 📌 Weekly roundup 

I know what you're thinking. "ugh, not another weekly roundup 🥱"

This isn't just about tech, or the future, or anything really. It's things I've read that are cool. I read. **a lot. **If you have a passion for learning, this newsletter is for you ✨

# 😎 Access to blog posts early

Yup! You'll have access to all of my stuff, early.

# 🤯 Access to blog posts that I haven't published

Sometimes, I write blog posts on non-computer topics. Either on writing well, nootropics, or how neurons work in the brain. I never publish these, because I don't feel like they'll fit anywhere. You'll have access to them 💡

## 🏆 Support an indie creator instead of a multi-national conglomerate

When you subscribe to me, you're supporting me directly. If I used Patreon, you'd be supporting Patreon as well as me. This way, you're only supporting me. 98% of your support will go to me, with 2% going towards the Stripe fee.

# Cancellation Policy

You can cancel whenever you want, with a refund for all the months left.

So if you've paid for 12 months and cancel in month 3, you get 9 months back. The usual kind of subscription.

To get a refund, just pop me an email. Brandon ([at]) skerritt.blog . The same email address that has emailed you right after. [If you're still stuck, tweet me! ](https://twitter.com/brandon_skerrit)
