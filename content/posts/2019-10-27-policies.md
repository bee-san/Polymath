# Cancellation Policy

You can cancel whenever you want, with a refund for all the months left.

So if you've paid for 12 months and cancel in month 3, you get 9 months back. The usual kind of subscription, no surprises there.

To get a refund, just pop me an email. Brandon ([at]) skerritt.blog . The same email address that has emailed you right after. [If you're still stuck, tweet me! ](https://twitter.com/brandon_skerrit)
