Unforuantely, there seemed to be very little information on the web about this.\nThis is a guide on packaging your Python project for:\n PyPi HomeBrew Windows Package Manager Arch User Respository  Ideas Publish each one seperately, and include a pdf containing the full book\nInclude github actions for these\nExplain semenatic versioning\nSemantic Versioning Semantic Versioning is a system defining how to write version numbers. The 3 numbers are:\nMajor.Minor.Bugs  If you have fixed some bugs, increment the bugs counter.\nIf you have added a minor feature, increment the minor counter.\nIf you have done something major, increment the major counter.\nWe can signify whether a release is still being rested or not by adding “rc” (release candidate) to the end of the version. “5.0.0rc1” signifies “release canidate 1” which means this is the first public testing release of version 5.0.0.\nPyPi The traditional method of using Setuptools is outdated and old. There’s a new cowboy in town, and their name is Poetry.\nPoetry creates a pyproject.yml file, which is the successor to the 3-file Setuptools sytem.\nYou should use Poetry because:\n Instead of 3 files, it is now 1 file That 1 file is yaml, which means you don’t have to cry reading weirdly formatted Python code used as a replacement for yaml You can seperate dev \u0026 normal dependencies, so users only install the dependencies they need to run the app It’s physically easier to build and upload to PyPi And a host of other things  Install poetry with pip3 install poetry.\nNavigate to your projects directory and run the command poetry init.\nThis will generate a pyproject.toml file. This file contains everything PyPi needs to upload your project, and allow other users to download it.\nLet’s run through the sections in this new file, and fill then out as we go.\n[tool.poetry]\nThis section relates to the metadata of your project.\nThe name, description, version etc.\nTo add a new variable to a .toml file, write it as if it were python name = \"project name\".\nThe most important ones we’ll want are:\n Name  What is the name of the project?\nname = \"Ciphey`   Version  The semantic version number.\nversion = \"5.0.0rc6\"   Description  Short one line description.\ndescription = \"Automated decryption tool\"   Authors  A list containing the authors name and email address. In the format of authors = [\"brandon \"]\n License  What license does the project use?\nlicense = \"MIT\"   readme  The name of the README.md file, in the same directory as pyproject.toml.\nreadme = \"README.md\"  Here is what Ciphey’s Pyproject looks like:\n[tool.poetry] name = \"ciphey\" version = \"5.0.0rc4\" description = \"Automated Decryption Tool\" authors = [\"Brandon \"] license = \"MIT\" documentation = \"https://docs.ciphey.online\" exclude = [\"tests/hansard.txt\"] readme = \"README.md\"  To find out what else you can include, check out the Poetry documentation.\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\nA list of all the dependnecies your project uses. Don’t worry! You don’t have to manually add them to te list.\nRun the command poetry add  to add a dependency to your project, and Poetry will automatically add it to your project.\nFor example, to add rich we would write poetry add rich.\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\nThe dependencies the developers of your tool rely on. To add the testing library Pytest, write poetry add --dev pytest.\n[tool.poetry.scripts]\nThis is the 2nd most important part! As it contains an entry point. When a user installs your package, you’d probably like them to be able to run package in their terminal and use your package.\nFor a folder called Ciphey with a file named Ciphey.py with a function called main(), we would write:\nciphey = 'ciphey.ciphey:main'  When the user runs the command ciphey, it actually runs the main function of the file ciphey of the folder ciphey.\nFor a more detailed explanation, check this out.\nPoetry Run poetry run runs our script, but includes the pyproject.toml file. It executes the given command inside of a virtual environment, essentially it allows us to test our project in the same way a user might run our program.\nPoetry Install Poetry install installs our program and all its dependencies. Essentially, we can test exactly what our users will do when they install the project for themselves.\nPoetry Update poetry update updates our dependencies.\nPoetry Build Now onto the most important commands. Poetry build builds our project, which means it generates some files that other users can install and use on their system.\nPoetry publish Poetry Publish will publish the package to PyPi for us. All we need to do is enter a username / password.\nAnd just like that, our project is now on PyPi for the whole world to download!\nAutomatic Uploading using github actions Windows Package Manager (WinGet) There are 3 steps to submitting your app to WinGet.\n Turning your project into an EXE Create a manifest file Create a pull request on GitHub  Turning your project into an EXE Windows requires an exe file for Python projects. Don’t fret! Turning your project into a exe file isn’t that difficult.\nDownload Pyinstaller, and then create an entry point in the root directory.\nAn entry point is a python file that when ran, will run the program. So for instance:\nCiphey/ |-entry_point.py |-ciphey/ |----main.py  Here the project code is in ciphey/. To run the program, we’d have to run python3 ciphey/main.py.\nThis is the typical file structure of a project. We have README.md and similar in the root, and all the source code into a sub-directory.\nWe need to create a program that calls our program using an entry point. The entry point is a function which runs the program.\nIf you have a setup.py or pyproject.yml, you may already have entry points defined in them.\nIn entry_point.py, we’d write:\nfrom ciphey.__main__ import main if __name__ == '__main__': main()  Or however your entry point is defined.\nNow, run Pyinstaller on the entry_point.py file. It will generate a new folder called dist/. If you are using the default Python .gitignore it will automatically disclude dist/. If not, please add it to the .gitignore!\nPyinstaller will also generate an entry_point.spec file in the root directory. This file contains a specification of how Pyinstaller should build your program.\nOnce built, run the program.\nYou will likely see some errors. Most likely bad imports. To fix this, define them in the spec file. There are a couple main lists in the spec file you should know about:\n Binaries  If you already hold a binary for a specific file / library (such as C++ compiled) then define the location here.\n Datas  If your program relies on .txt data, or anything that isn’t a Python file define it here.\n Hidden Imports  Hidden imports look like __import__. These types of imports are not visible to Pyinstaller’s analysis, so to get around this define the imports in the Hidden imports section.\n Excludes  Exclude a package from Pyinstaller. I had an error with Setuptools, but since Setuptools isn’t needed to run Ciphey I told Pyinstaller to exclude the entire package.\nIf you have edited the .spec file, you may want to delete the line from the .gitignore which states to ignore the file. Otherwise, all the hard work you’ve spent in getting Pyinstaller to work may be lost.\nOne thing to note. Pyinstaller only creates executables for the system you are on. You cannot build a Windows .exe from Linux. You have to be on the system you are trying to build for. Pyinstaller can create these binaries (assuming you own the operating systems for them):\n Windows .exe Mac OS’ .app Linux’s Binary Files  Once built and packaged, running the executable on Windows / Mac will bring up the Terminal (assuming you do not have any GUI). If you do, it will bring up the GUI.\nPyinstaller packages an entire Python intrepreter with the binary, So do not worry about the user having Python installed.\nManifest File Now we have an exe. I would suggest converting to MSIX.\nExes are cool and all, but they’re not really package manager matieral. Winget with an .exe is a glorified Softonic / CNET Software. MSIX gives us the real power to:\n Automatically update the app Uninstall cleanly Understand what dependencies are required  So in short, if we use an .exe it is just a glorified Software downloader. If we use .msix it is more of a package mamnager.\nBelow is the manifest.yml file for Ciphey.\nId: Ciphey.Ciphey Publisher: Ciphey Name: Ciphey Version: 5 AppMoniker: Ciphey MinOSVersion: 10.0.0.0 Description: Automated Decryption Tool Homepage: https://www.github.com/ciphey/ciphey License: MIT LicenseUrl: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT InstallerType: exe Installers: - Arch: x64 Url: https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-windows-x64/1.3.00.4461/Teams_windows_x64.exe Sha256: 712f139d71e56bfb306e4a7b739b0e1109abb662dfa164192a5cfd6adb24a4e1 ManifestVersion: 0.1.0  Ciphey’s manifest file Let’s walk through quickly what each potentially confusing part is. I’ll leave things like “Name” and “License” as they are self-explanatory.\n ID  This follows a publisher.package format. Your publishers name, and then the package name.\n App Moniker  What’s the common name people search for your package with? For example “Visual Studio Code” can also be found with “vscode”.\nIf you have a long package name and your users often shorten it, this will be helpful to you.\n MinOSVersion  What is the minimum version of Windows the app supports? 10.0.0.0 means Windows 10 and above.\n InstallerType  What type of installer do you have? If you followed along, you should have an .exe file.\n Installers  This details how to install your package.\n Architecturue  What architecture does your project support? Examples include arm, arm64, x86, x64 and neutral.\nThe ones you’re probably after are either x86 or x64. x86 is for 32-bit operating systems, x64 is for 64-bit operating systems.\nURL  What is the URL of the .exe installer for your project? Personally, I hosted this on GitHub.\nSHA256  What is the SHA256 checksum of your .exe file? There’s an article here detailing how to calculate it.\n Manifest Version  Everytime you update this file, update the manifest version numbering using Semantic Versioning.\nArch User Respository ",

<p>I was looking to package my project, Ciphey, for operating systems and for managers that isn&rsquo;t PyPi. Unforuantely, there seemed to be very little information on the web about this.</p>

<p>The traditional method of using Setuptools is outdated and old. There&rsquo;s a new cowboy in town, and their name is Poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry creates a <code>pyproject.yml</code> file, which is the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">successor</a> to the 3-file Setuptools sytem.</p>
<p>You should use Poetry because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of 3 files, it is now 1 file</li>
<li>That 1 file is yaml, which means you don&rsquo;t have to cry reading weirdly formatted Python code used as a replacement for yaml</li>

<p>Navigate to your projects directory and run the command <code>poetry init</code>.</p>
<p>This will generate a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. This file contains everything PyPi needs to upload your project, and allow other users to download it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run through the sections in this new file, and fill then out as we go.</p>

<p>The name, description, version etc.</p>
<p>To add a new variable to a .toml file, write it as if it were python <code>name = &quot;project name&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>The most important ones we&rsquo;ll want are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the name of the project?</p>
<pre><code>name = &quot;Ciphey`

<ul>
<li>Version</li>

<p>Run the command <code>poetry add &lt;dependency&gt;</code> to add a dependency to your project, and Poetry will automatically add it to your project.</p>
<p>For example, to add <code>rich</code> we would write <code>poetry add rich</code>.</p>
<p><strong>[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]</strong></p>
<p>The dependencies the developers of your tool rely on. To add the testing library Pytest, write <code>poetry add --dev pytest</code>.</p>
<p><strong>[tool.poetry.scripts]</strong></p>
<p>This is the 2nd most important part! As it contains an entry point. When a user installs your package, you&rsquo;d probably like them to be able to run <code>package</code> in their terminal and use your package.</p>
<p>For a folder called Ciphey with a file named Ciphey.py with a function called main(), we would write:</p>
<pre><code>ciphey = 'ciphey.ciphey:main'
</code></pre>
<p>When the user runs the command <code>ciphey</code>, it actually runs the main function of the file ciphey of the folder ciphey.</p>

<h2 id="poetry-run">Poetry Run<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poetry-run">#</a></h2>
<p><code>poetry run</code> runs our script, but includes the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. It executes the given command inside of a virtual environment, essentially it allows us to test our project in the same way a user might run our program.</p>
<h2 id="poetry-install">Poetry Install<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poetry-install">#</a></h2>
<p><code>Poetry install</code> installs our program and all its dependencies. Essentially, we can test exactly what our users will do when they install the project for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="poetry-update">Poetry Update<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poetry-update">#</a></h2>
<p><code>poetry update</code> updates our dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="poetry-build">Poetry Build<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poetry-build">#</a></h2>
<p>Now onto the most important commands. <code>Poetry build</code> builds our project, which means it generates some files that other users can install and use on their system.</p>
<h2 id="poetry-publish">Poetry publish<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poetry-publish">#</a></h2>
<p><code>Poetry Publish</code> will publish the package to PyPi for us. All we need to do is enter a username / password.</p>
<p>And just like that, our project is now on PyPi for the whole world to download!</p>

<h2 id="turning-your-project-into-an-exe">Turning your project into an EXE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#turning-your-project-into-an-exe">#</a></h2>
<p>Windows requires an exe file for Python projects. Don&rsquo;t fret! Turning your project into a exe file isn&rsquo;t that difficult.</p>
<p>Download Pyinstaller, and then create an <code>entry point</code> in the root directory.</p>
<p>An entry point is a python file that when ran, will run the program. So for instance:</p>
<pre><code>Ciphey/
|-entry_point.py
|-ciphey/
|----main.py
</code></pre>
<p>Here the project code is in <code>ciphey/</code>. To run the program, we&rsquo;d have to run <code>python3 ciphey/main.py</code>.</p>
<p>This is the typical file structure of a project. We have README.md and similar in the root, and all the source code into a sub-directory.</p>
<p>We need to create a program that calls our program using an entry point. The entry point is a function which runs the program.</p>
<p>If you have a <code>setup.py</code> or <code>pyproject.yml</code>, you may already have entry points defined in them.</p>
<p>In <code>entry_point.py</code>, we&rsquo;d write:</p>
<pre><code>from ciphey.__main__ import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Or however your entry point is defined.</p>
<p>Now, run Pyinstaller on the <code>entry_point.py</code> file. It will generate a new folder called <code>dist/</code>. If you are using the default Python <code>.gitignore</code> it will automatically disclude <code>dist/</code>. If not, please add it to the <code>.gitignore</code>!</p>
<p>Pyinstaller will also generate an <code>entry_point.spec</code> file in the root directory. This file contains a specification of how Pyinstaller should build your program.</p>
<p>Once built, run the program.</p>
<p>You will likely see some errors. Most likely bad imports. To fix this, define them in the spec file. There are a couple main lists in the spec file you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binaries</li>
</ul>
<p>If you already hold a binary for a specific file / library (such as C++ compiled) then define the location here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Datas</li>
</ul>
<p>If your program relies on .txt data, or anything that isn&rsquo;t a Python file define it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden Imports</li>
</ul>
<p>Hidden imports look like <code>__import__</code>.  These types of imports are not visible to Pyinstaller&rsquo;s analysis, so to get around this define the imports in the Hidden imports section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excludes</li>
</ul>
<p>Exclude a package from Pyinstaller. I had an error with Setuptools, but since Setuptools isn&rsquo;t needed to run Ciphey I told Pyinstaller to exclude the entire package.</p>
<p>If you have edited the <code>.spec</code> file, you may want to delete the line from the <code>.gitignore</code> which states to ignore the file. Otherwise, all the hard work you&rsquo;ve spent in getting Pyinstaller to work may be lost.</p>
<p><strong>One thing to note</strong>. Pyinstaller only creates executables for the system you are on. You cannot build a Windows .exe from Linux. You have to be on the system you are trying to build for. Pyinstaller can create these binaries (assuming you own the operating systems for them):</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows .exe</li>
<li>Mac OS&rsquo; .app</li>
<li>Linux&rsquo;s Binary Files</li>
</ul>
<p>Once built and packaged, running the executable on Windows / Mac will bring up the Terminal (assuming you do not have any GUI). If you do, it will bring up the GUI.</p>
<p>Pyinstaller packages an entire Python intrepreter with the binary, So do not worry about the user having Python installed.</p>
<h2 id="manifest-file">Manifest File<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#manifest-file">#</a></h2>
<p>Now we have an exe. I would suggest converting to MSIX.</p>
<p>Exes are cool and all, but they&rsquo;re not really package manager matieral. Winget with an .exe is a glorified Softonic / CNET Software. MSIX gives us the real power to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically update the app</li>
<li>Uninstall cleanly</li>
<li>Understand what dependencies are required</li>
</ul>
<p>So in short, if we use an .exe it is just a glorified Software downloader. If we use .msix it is more of a package mamnager.</p>
<p>Below is the <code>manifest.yml</code> file for Ciphey.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Ciphey&rsquo;s manifest file
Let&rsquo;s walk through quickly what each potentially confusing part is. I&rsquo;ll leave things like &ldquo;Name&rdquo; and &ldquo;License&rdquo; as they are self-explanatory.</p>
<ul>
<li>ID</li>
</ul>
<p>This follows a <code>publisher.package</code> format. Your publishers name, and then the package name.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Moniker</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s the common name people search for your package with? For example &ldquo;Visual Studio Code&rdquo; can also be found with &ldquo;vscode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you have a long package name and your users often shorten it, this will be helpful to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>MinOSVersion</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the minimum version of Windows the app supports? <code>10.0.0.0</code> means Windows 10 and above.</p>
<ul>
<li>InstallerType</li>
</ul>
<p>What type of installer do you have? If you followed along, you should have an .exe file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installers</li>
</ul>
<p>This details how to install your package.</p>
<ol>
<li>Architecturue</li>
</ol>
<p>What architecture does your project support? Examples include <code>arm, arm64, x86, x64 and neutral</code>.</p>
<p>The ones you&rsquo;re probably after are either x86 or x64. x86 is for 32-bit operating systems, x64 is for 64-bit operating systems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>URL</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the URL of the .exe installer for your project? Personally, I hosted this on GitHub.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>SHA256</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the SHA256 checksum of your .exe file? There&rsquo;s an article <a href="https://kanguru.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/235228027-SHA256-Checksum-Utilities">here</a> detailing how to calculate it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manifest Version</li>
</ul>
<p>Everytime you update this file, update the manifest version numbering using Semantic Versioning.</p>
