We call algorithms greedy when they utilise the greedy property. The greedy property is:\n At that exact moment in time, what is the optimal choice to make?\n Greedy algorithms are greedy. They do not look into the future to decide the global optimal solution. They are only concerned with the optimal solution locally. This means that the overall optimal solution may differ from the solution the algorithm chooses.\nThey never look backwards at what they‚Äôve done to see if they could optimise globally. This is the main difference between Greedy and Dynamic Programming.\nTo be extra clear, one of the most Googled questions about greedy algorithms is:\n ‚ÄúWhat problem-solving strategies don‚Äôt guarantee solutions but make efficient use of time?‚Äù\n The answer is ‚ÄúGreedy algorithms‚Äù. They don‚Äôt guarantee solutions, but are very time efficient. However, in the next section we‚Äôll learn that sometimes Greedy solutions give us the optimal solutions.\n What Are Greedy Algorithms Used For? Greedy algorithms are quick. A lot faster than the two other alternatives (Divide \u0026 Conquer, and Dynamic Programming). They‚Äôre used because they‚Äôre fast.\nSometimes, Greedy algorithms give the global optimal solution everytime. Some of these algorithms are:\n Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm Prim‚Äôs algorithm Huffman trees  These algorithms are Greedy, and their Greedy solution gives the optimal solution.\nWe‚Äôre going to explore greedy algorithms using examples, and learning how it all works.\n How Do I Create a Greedy Algorithm? Your algorithm needs to follow this property:\n At that exact moment in time, what is the optimal choice to make?\n And that‚Äôs it. There isn‚Äôt much to it. Greedy algorithms are easier to code than Divide \u0026 Conquer or Dynamic Programming.\n Counting Change Using Greedy Imagine you‚Äôre a vending machine. Someone gives you ¬£1 and buys a drink for ¬£0.70p. There‚Äôs no 30p coin in pound sterling, how do you calculate how much change to return?\nFor reference, this is the denomination of each coin in the UK:\n1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, ¬£1  The greedy algorithm starts from the highest denomination and works backwards. Our algorithm starts at ¬£1. ¬£1 is more than 30p, so it can‚Äôt use it. It does this for 50p. It reaches 20p. 20p The algorithm needs to return change of 10p. It tries 20p again, but 20p  10p. It next goes to 10p. It chooses 1 10p, and now our return is 0 we stop the algorithm.\nWe return 1x20p and 1x10p.\nThis algorithm works well in real life. Let‚Äôs use another example, this time we have the denomination next to how many of that coin is in the machine, (denomination, how many).\n(1p, 10), (2p, 3), (5p, 1), (10p, 0), (20p, 1p), (50p, 19p), (100p, 16)  The algorithm is asked to return change of 30p again. 100p (¬£1) is no. Same for 50. 20p, we can do that. We pick 1x 20p. We now need to return 10p. 20p has run out, so we move down 1.\n10p has run out, so we move down 1.\nWe have 5p, so we choose 1x5p. We now need to return 5p. 5p has run out, so we move down one.\nWe choose 1 2p coin. We now need to return 3p. We choose another 2p coin. We now need to return 1p. We move down one.\nWe choose 1x 1p coin.\nOur algorithm selected these coins to return as change:\n# (value, how many we return as change) (10, 1) (5, 1) (2, 2) (1, 1)  Let‚Äôs code something. First, we need to define the problem. We‚Äôll start with the denominations.\ndenominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100] # 100p is ¬£1  Now onto the core function. Given denominations and an amount to give change, we want to return a list of how many times that coin was returned.\nIf our denominations list is as above, [6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] represents taking 6 1p coins and 3 2p coins, but 0 of all other coins.\ndenominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100] # 100p is ¬£1 def returnChange(change, denominations): toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations) for pos, coin in reversed(list(enumerate(denominations))):  We create a list, the size of denominations long and fill it with 0‚Äôs.\nWe want to loop backwards, from largest to smallest. Reversed(x) reverses x and lets us loop backwards. Enumerate means ‚Äúfor loop through this list, but keep the position in another variable‚Äù. In our example when we start the loop. coin = 100 and pos = 6.\nOur next step is choosing a coin for as long as we can use that coin. If we need to give change = 40 we want our algorithm to choose 20, then 20 again until it can no longer use 20. We do this using a for loop.\ndenominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100] # 100p is ¬£1 def returnChange(change, denominations): # makes a list size of length denominations filled with 0 toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations) # goes backwards through denominations list # and also keeps track of the counter, pos. for pos, coin in enumerate(reversed(denominations)): # while we can still use coin, use it until we can't while coin  While the coin can still fit into change, add that coin to our return list, toGiveBack and remove it from change.\ndenominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100] # 100p is ¬£1 def returnChange(change, denominations): # makes a list size of length denominations filled with 0 toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations) # goes backwards through denominations list # and also keeps track of the counter, pos. for pos, coin in enumerate(reversed(denominations)): # while we can still use coin, use it until we can't while coin  The runtime of this algorithm is dominated by the 2 loops, thus it is $O(n^2)$.\n Is Greedy Optimal? Does Greedy Always Work? It is optimal locally, but sometimes it isn‚Äôt optimal globally. In the change giving algorithm, we can force a point at which it isn‚Äôt optimal globally.\nThe algorithm for doing this is:\n Pick 3 denominations of coins. 1p, x, and less than 2x but more than x.  We‚Äôll pick 1, 15, 25.\n Ask for change of 2 * second denomination (15)  We‚Äôll ask for change of 30. Now, let‚Äôs see what our Greedy algorithm does.\n[5, 0, 1]  It choses 1x 25p, and 5x 1p. The optimal solution is 2x 15p.\nOur Greedy algorithm failed because it didn‚Äôt look at 15p. It looked at 25p and thought ‚Äúyup, that fits. Let‚Äôs take it.‚Äù\nIt then looked at 15p and thought ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt fit, let‚Äôs move on‚Äù.\nThis is an example of where Greedy Algorithms fail.\nTo get around this, you would either have to create currency where this doesn‚Äôt work or to brute-force the solution. Or use Dynamic Programming.\n Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm finds the shortest path from a node to every other node in the graph. In our example, we‚Äôll be using a weighted directed graph. Each edge has a direction, and each edge has a weight.\nDijkstra‚Äôs algorithm has many uses. It can be very useful within road networks where you need to find the fastest route to a place. We also use the algorithm for:\n IP Routing A* Algorithm Telephone networks  The algorithm follows these rules:\n Every time we want to visit a new node, we will choose the node with the smallest known distance. Once we‚Äôve moved to the node, we check each of its neighbouring nodes. We calculate the distance from the neighbouring nodes to the root nodes by summing the cost of the edges that lead to that new node. If the distance to a node is less than a known distance, we‚Äôll update the shortest distance.  Our first step is to pick the starting node. Let‚Äôs choose A. All the distances start at infinity, as we don‚Äôt know their distance until we reach a node that knows the distance. We mark off A on our unvisited nodes list. The distance from A to A is 0. The distance from A to B is 4. The distance from A to C is 2. We updated our distance listing on the right-hand side.\nWe pick the smallest edge where the vertex hasn‚Äôt been chosen. The smallest edge is A - C, and we haven‚Äôt chosen C yet. We visit C.\nNotice how we‚Äôre picking the smallest distance from our current node to a node we haven‚Äôt visited yet. We‚Äôre being greedy. Here, the greedy method is the global optimal solution. We can get to B from C. We now need to pick a minimum. $min(4, 2 + 1) = 3$. Since A - C - B is smaller than A - B, we update B with this information. We then add in the distances from the other nodes we can now reach. Our next smallest vertex with a node we haven‚Äôt visited yet is B, with 3. We visit B. We do the same for B. Then we pick the smallest vertex we haven‚Äôt visited yet, D. We don‚Äôt update any of the distances this time. Our last node is then E. There are no updates again. To find the shortest path from A to the other nodes, we walk back through our graph.\nWe pick A first, C second, B third. If you need to create the shortest path from A to every other node as a graph, you can run this algorithm using a table on the right-hand side. Dijkstra‚Äôs TableNodeDistance from APrevious nodeA0N/AB3CC2AD5BE6B Using this table it is easy to draw out the shortest distance from A to every other node in the graph:  Minimum Spanning Trees Using Prim‚Äôs Algorithm Prim‚Äôs algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. It finds the optimal route from every node to every other node in the tree.\nWith a small change to Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, we can build a new algorithm - Prim‚Äôs algorithm!\nWe informally describe the algorithm as:\n Create a new tree with a single vertex (chosen randomly) Of all the edges not yet in the new tree, find the minimum weighted edge and transfer it to the new tree Repeat step 2 until all vertices are in the tree  This example is taken from here. We have this graph.\nOur next step is to pick an arbitrary node. We pick the node A. We then examine all the edges connecting A to other vertices. Prim‚Äôs algorithm is greedy. That means it picks the shortest edge that connects to an unvisited vertex.\nIn our example, it picks B. We now look at all nodes reachable from A **and **B. This is the distinction between Dijkstra‚Äôs and Prim‚Äôs. With Dijkstra‚Äôs, we‚Äôre looking for a path from 1 node to a certain other node (nodes that have not been visited). With Prim‚Äôs, we want the minimum spanning tree.\nWe have 3 edges with equal weights of 3. We pick 1 randomly. It is helpful to highlight our graph as we go along, because it makes it easier to create the minimum spanning tree. Now we look at all edges of A, B, and C. The shortest edge is C  E with a weight of 1. And we repeat: The edge B  E with a weight of 3 is the smallest edge. However, both vertices are always in our VISITED list. Meaning we do not pick this edge. We instead choose C  F, as we have not visited The only node left is G, so let‚Äôs visit it. Note that if the edge weights are distinct, the minimum spanning tree is unique. We can add the edge weights to get the minimum spanning tree‚Äôs total edge weight:\n$$2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 24$$\n Fractional Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Algorithm Imagine you are a thief. You break into the house of Judy Holliday - 1951 Oscar winner for Best Actress. Judy is a hoarder of gems. Judy‚Äôs house is lined to the brim with gems.\nYou brought with you a bag - a knapsack if you will. This bag has a weight of 7. You happened to have a listing of Judy‚Äôs items, from some insurance paper. The items read as: Judy‚Äôs ItemsNameValueWeightDiamonds165Francium31Sapphire62Emerald21 The first step to solving the fractional knapsack problem is to calculate $\\frac{value}{weight}$ for each item. Judy‚Äôs ItemsNameValueWeightValue / weightDiamonds1653.2Francium313Sapphire623Emerald212 And now we greedily select the largest ones. To do this, we can sort them according to $\\frac{value}{weight}$ in descending order. Luckily for us, they are already sorted. The largest one is 3.2.\nknapsack value = 16 knapsack total weight = 5 (out of 7)  Then we select Francium (I know it‚Äôs not a gem, but Judy is a bit strange üòâ)\nknapsack value = 19 knapsack weight = 6  Now, we add Sapphire. But if we add Sapphire, our total weight will come to 8.\nIn the fractional knapsack problem, we can cut items up to take fractions of them. We have a weight of 1 left in the bag. Our sapphire is weight 2. We calculate the ratio of:\n$$\\frac{weight;of;knapsack;left}{weight;of;item}$$\nAnd then multiply this ratio by the value of the item to get how much value of that item we can take.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} * 6 = 3$$\nknapsack value = 21 knapsack weight = 7  The greedy algorithm can optimally solve the fractional knapsack problem, but it cannot optimally solve the {0, 1} knapsack problem. In this problem instead of taking a fraction of an item, you either take it {1} or you don‚Äôt {0}. To solve this, you need to use Dynamic Programming.\nThe runtime for this algorithm is O(n log n). Calculating $\\frac{value}{weight}$ is O(1). Our main step is sorting from largest $\\frac{value}{weight}$, which takes O(n log n) time.\n Greedy vs Divide \u0026 Conquer vs Dynamic Programming Greedy vs Divide \u0026 Conquer vs Dynamic ProgrammingGreedyDivide \u0026 ConquerDynamic ProgrammingOptimises by making the best choice at the momentOptimises by breaking down a subproblem into simpler versions of itself and using multi-threading \u0026 recursion to solveSame as Divide and Conquer, but optimises by caching the answers to each subproblem as not to repeat the calculation twice.Doesn‚Äôt always find the optimal solution, but is very fastAlways finds the optimal solution, but is slower than GreedyAlways finds the optimal solution, but could be pointless on small datasets.Requires almost no memoryRequires some memory to remember recursive callsRequires a lot of memory for memoisation / tabulationTo learn more about Divide \u0026 Conquer and Dynamic Programming, check out these 2 posts I wrote:\n Divide \u0026 Conquer Dynamic Programming   Conclusion Greedy algorithms are very fast, but may not provide the optimal solution.

<h2 id="why-are-greedy-algorithms-called-greedy">Why Are Greedy Algorithms Called Greedy?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-are-greedy-algorithms-called-greedy">#</a></h2>
<p>We call algorithms <em>greedy</em> when they utilise the greedy property. The greedy property is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that exact moment in time, what is the optimal choice to make?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greedy algorithms are greedy. They do not look into the future to decide the global optimal solution. They are only concerned with the optimal solution locally. This means that <strong>the overall optimal solution may differ from the solution the algorithm chooses.</strong></p>
<p>They never look backwards at what they&rsquo;ve done to see if they could optimise globally. This is the main difference between Greedy and <a href="/dynamic-programming/">Dynamic Programming</a>.</p>
<p>To be extra clear, one of the most Googled questions about greedy algorithms is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What problem-solving strategies don&rsquo;t guarantee solutions but make efficient use of time?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;Greedy algorithms&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t guarantee solutions, but are very time efficient. However, in the next section we&rsquo;ll learn that sometimes Greedy solutions give us the optimal solutions.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-greedy-algorithms-used-for">What Are Greedy Algorithms Used For?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-greedy-algorithms-used-for">#</a></h2>
<p>Greedy algorithms are quick. A lot faster than the two other alternatives (<a href="/divide-and-conquer-algorithms/">Divide &amp; Conquer</a>, and <a href="/dynamic-programming/">Dynamic Programming</a>). They&rsquo;re used because they&rsquo;re fast.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Greedy algorithms give the global optimal solution everytime. Some of these algorithms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/papers/tracking2011.pdf">Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm</a></li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_tree">Huffman trees</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These algorithms are Greedy, and their Greedy solution gives the optimal solution.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to explore greedy algorithms using examples, and learning how it all works.</p>

<p>Your algorithm needs to follow this property:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that exact moment in time, what is the optimal choice to make?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it. There isn&rsquo;t much to it. Greedy algorithms are easier to code than <a href="/divide-and-conquer-algorithms/">Divide &amp; Conquer</a> or <a href="/dynamic-programming/">Dynamic Programming</a>.</p>

<h1 id="counting-change-using-greedy">Counting Change Using Greedy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#counting-change-using-greedy">#</a></h1>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a vending machine. Someone gives you ¬£1 and buys a drink for ¬£0.70p. There&rsquo;s no 30p coin in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling">pound sterling</a>, how do you calculate how much change to return?</p>
<p>For reference, this is the denomination of each coin in the UK:</p>
<pre><code>1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, ¬£1
</code></pre>
<p>The greedy algorithm starts from the highest denomination and works backwards. Our algorithm starts at ¬£1. ¬£1 is more than 30p, so it can&rsquo;t use it. It does this for 50p. It reaches 20p. 20p &lt; 30p, so it takes 1 20p.</p>
<p>The algorithm needs to return change of 10p. It tries 20p again, but 20p &gt; 10p. It next goes to 10p. It chooses 1 10p, and now our return is 0 we stop the algorithm.</p>
<p>We return 1x20p and 1x10p.</p>
<p>This algorithm works well in real life. Let&rsquo;s use another example, this time we have the denomination next to how many of that coin is in the machine, <code>(denomination, how many)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(1p, 10), (2p, 3), (5p, 1), (10p, 0), (20p, 1p), (50p, 19p), (100p, 16)
</code></pre>
<p>The algorithm is asked to return change of 30p again. 100p (¬£1) is no. Same for 50. 20p, we can do that. We pick 1x 20p. We now need to return 10p. 20p has run out, so we move down 1.</p>
<p>10p has run out, so we move down 1.</p>
<p>We have 5p, so we choose 1x5p. We now need to return 5p. 5p has run out, so we move down one.</p>
<p>We choose 1 2p coin. We now need to return 3p. We choose another 2p coin. We now need to return 1p. We move down one.</p>
<p>We choose 1x 1p coin.</p>
<p>Our algorithm selected these coins to return as change:</p>
<pre><code># (value, how many we return as change)
(10, 1)
(5, 1)
(2, 2)
(1, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s code something. First, we need to define the problem. We&rsquo;ll start with the denominations.</p>
<pre><code>denominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
# 100p is ¬£1
</code></pre>
<p>Now onto the core function. Given denominations and an amount to give change, we want to return a list of how many times that coin was returned.</p>
<p>If our <code>denominations</code> list is as above, <code>[6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code> represents taking 6 1p coins and 3 2p coins, but 0 of all other coins.</p>
<pre><code>denominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
# 100p is ¬£1

def returnChange(change, denominations):
    toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations)
    for pos, coin in reversed(list(enumerate(denominations))):
</code></pre>
<p>We create a list, the size of denominations long and fill it with 0&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We want to loop backwards, from largest to smallest. <code>Reversed(x)</code> reverses x and lets us loop backwards. Enumerate means &ldquo;for loop through this list, but keep the position in another variable&rdquo;. In our example when we start the loop. <code>coin = 100</code> and <code>pos = 6</code>.</p>
<p>Our next step is choosing a coin for as long as we can use that coin. If we need to give <code>change = 40</code> we want our algorithm to choose 20, then 20 again until it can no longer use 20. We do this using a for loop.</p>
<pre><code>denominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
# 100p is ¬£1

def returnChange(change, denominations):
    # makes a list size of length denominations filled with 0
    toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations)

    # goes backwards through denominations list
    # and also keeps track of the counter, pos.
    for pos, coin in enumerate(reversed(denominations)):
        # while we can still use coin, use it until we can't
        while coin &lt;= change:
</code></pre>
<p>While the coin can still fit into change, add that coin to our return list, <code>toGiveBack</code> and remove it from change.</p>
<pre><code>denominations = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
# 100p is ¬£1

def returnChange(change, denominations):
    # makes a list size of length denominations filled with 0
    toGiveBack = [0] * len(denominations)

    # goes backwards through denominations list
    # and also keeps track of the counter, pos.
    for pos, coin in enumerate(reversed(denominations)):
        # while we can still use coin, use it until we can't
        while coin &lt;= change:
            change = change - coin
            toGiveBack[pos] += 1
    return(toGiveBack)
			
print(returnChange(30, denominations))
# returns [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
# 1x 10p, 1x 20p
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="/you-need-to-understand-big-o-notation-now/">runtime </a>of this algorithm is dominated by the 2 loops, thus it is $O(n^2)$.</p>

<h2 id="is-greedy-optimal-does-greedy-always-work">Is Greedy Optimal? Does Greedy Always Work?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-greedy-optimal-does-greedy-always-work">#</a></h2>
<p>It is optimal locally, but sometimes it isn&rsquo;t optimal globally. In the change giving algorithm, we can force a point at which it isn&rsquo;t optimal globally.</p>
<p>The algorithm for doing this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick 3 denominations of coins. 1p, x, and less than 2x but more than x.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll pick 1, 15, 25.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for change of 2 * second denomination (15)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll ask for change of 30. Now, let&rsquo;s see what our Greedy algorithm does.</p>
<pre><code>[5, 0, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>It choses 1x 25p, and 5x 1p. The optimal solution is 2x 15p.</p>
<p>Our Greedy algorithm failed because it didn&rsquo;t look at 15p. It looked at 25p and thought &ldquo;yup, that fits. Let&rsquo;s take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It then looked at 15p and thought &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t fit, let&rsquo;s move on&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is an example of where Greedy Algorithms fail.</p>
<p>To get around this, you would either have to create currency where this doesn&rsquo;t work or to brute-force the solution. Or use Dynamic Programming.</p>

<h1 id="dijkstras-algorithm">Dijkstra&rsquo;s Algorithm<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dijkstras-algorithm">#</a></h1>
<p>Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm finds the shortest path from a node to every other node in the graph. In our example, we&rsquo;ll be using a <a href="/graph-theory/">weighted directed graph</a>. Each edge has a direction, and each edge has a weight.</p>
<p>Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm has many uses. It can be very useful within road networks where you need to find the fastest route to a place. We also use the algorithm for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5381955">IP Routing</a></li>
<li><a href="/a-primer-on-search-algorithms/">A* Algorithm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019006003498">Telephone networks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm follows these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every time we want to visit a new node, we will choose the node with the smallest known distance.</li>
<li>Once we&rsquo;ve moved to the node, we check each of its neighbouring nodes. We calculate the distance from the neighbouring nodes to the root nodes by summing the cost of the edges that lead to that new node.</li>
<li>If the distance to a node is less than a known distance, we&rsquo;ll update the shortest distance.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-33-.png" alt="">
Our first step is to pick the starting node. Let&rsquo;s choose A. All the distances start at infinity, as we don&rsquo;t know their distance until we reach a node that knows the distance.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-35-.png" alt="">
We mark off A on our unvisited nodes list. The distance from A to A is 0. The distance from A to B is 4. The distance from A to C is 2. We updated our distance listing on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>We pick the smallest edge where the vertex hasn&rsquo;t been chosen. The smallest edge is A -&gt; C, and we haven&rsquo;t chosen C yet. We visit C.</p>
<p>Notice how we&rsquo;re picking the smallest distance from our current node to a node we haven&rsquo;t visited yet. We&rsquo;re being greedy. Here, the greedy method is the global optimal solution.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-36-.png" alt="">
We can get to B from C. We now need to pick a minimum. $min(4, 2 + 1) = 3$.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-37-.png" alt="">
Since A -&gt; C -&gt; B is smaller than A -&gt; B, we update B with this information. We then add in the distances from the other nodes we can now reach.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-40-.png" alt="">
Our next smallest vertex with a node we haven&rsquo;t visited yet is B, with 3. We visit B.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-41-.png" alt="">
We do the same for B. Then we pick the smallest vertex we haven&rsquo;t visited yet, D.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-42-.png" alt="">
We don&rsquo;t update any of the distances this time. Our last node is then E.
<img src="/content/images/2019/06/Blank-Diagram-43-.png" alt="">
There are no updates again. To find the shortest path from A to the other nodes, we walk back through our graph.</p>
<h2 id="contentimages201906blank-diagram-44-png">We pick A first, C second, B third. If you need to create the shortest path from A to every other node as a graph, you can run this algorithm using a table on the right-hand side.
Dijkstra&rsquo;s TableNodeDistance from APrevious nodeA0N/AB3CC2AD5BE6B
Using this table it is easy to draw out the shortest distance from A to every other node in the graph:

<h1 id="minimum-spanning-trees-using-prims-algorithm">Minimum Spanning Trees Using Prim&rsquo;s Algorithm<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#minimum-spanning-trees-using-prims-algorithm">#</a></h1>
<p>Prim&rsquo;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. It finds the optimal route from every node to every other node in the tree.</p>
<p>With a small change to Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, we can build a new algorithm - Prim&rsquo;s algorithm!</p>
<p>We informally describe the algorithm as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new tree with a single vertex (chosen randomly)</li>
<li>Of all the edges not yet in the new tree, find the minimum weighted edge and transfer it to the new tree</li>
<li>Repeat step 2 until all vertices are in the tree</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm1-1.svg" alt=""><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cplfcGZmX7I">This example is taken from here.</a>
We have this graph.</p>
<p>Our next step is to pick an arbitrary node.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm2-1.svg" alt="">
We pick the node A. We then examine all the edges connecting A to other vertices. Prim&rsquo;s algorithm is greedy. That means <strong>it picks the shortest edge that connects to an unvisited vertex.</strong></p>
<p>In our example, it picks B.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm3-1.svg" alt="">
We now look at all nodes reachable from A **and **B. This is the distinction between Dijkstra&rsquo;s and Prim&rsquo;s. With Dijkstra&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re looking for a path from 1 node to a certain other node (nodes that have not been visited). With Prim&rsquo;s, we want the minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>We have 3 edges with equal weights of 3. We pick 1 randomly.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm4-1.svg" alt="">
It is helpful to highlight our graph as we go along, because it makes it easier to create the minimum spanning tree.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm5-1.svg" alt="">
Now we look at all edges of A, B, and C. The shortest edge is C &gt; E with a weight of 1.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm6-3.svg" alt="">
And we repeat:
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm7-1.svg" alt="">
The edge B &gt; E with a weight of 3 is the smallest edge. However, both vertices are always in our <code>VISITED</code> list. Meaning we do not pick this edge. We instead choose C &gt; F, as we have not visited
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm8.svg" alt="">
The only node left is G, so let&rsquo;s visit it.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm9.svg" alt="">
Note that if the edge weights are distinct, the minimum spanning tree is unique.
<img src="/content/images/2019/10/Prim-sAlgorithm10.svg" alt="">
We can add the edge weights to get the minimum spanning tree&rsquo;s total edge weight:</p>
<p>$$2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 24$$</p>

<h2 id="fractional-knapsack-problem-using-greedy-algorithm">Fractional Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Algorithm<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fractional-knapsack-problem-using-greedy-algorithm">#</a></h2>
<p>Imagine you are a thief. You break into the house of Judy Holliday - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_Academy_Awards">1951 Oscar winner for Best Actress</a>. Judy is a hoarder of gems. Judy&rsquo;s house is lined to the brim with gems.</p>
<p>You brought with you a bag - a knapsack if you will. This bag has a weight of 7. You happened to have a listing of ¬†Judy&rsquo;s items, from some insurance paper. The items read as:
Judy&rsquo;s ItemsNameValueWeightDiamonds165Francium31Sapphire62Emerald21
The first step to solving the fractional knapsack problem is to calculate $\frac{value}{weight}$ for each item.
Judy&rsquo;s ItemsNameValueWeightValue / weightDiamonds1653.2Francium313Sapphire623Emerald212
And now we greedily select the largest ones. To do this, we can sort them according to $\frac{value}{weight}$ in descending order. Luckily for us, they are already sorted. The largest one is 3.2.</p>
<pre><code>knapsack value = 16
knapsack total weight = 5 (out of 7)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we select Francium (I know it&rsquo;s not a gem, but Judy is a bit strange üòâ)</p>
<pre><code>knapsack value = 19
knapsack weight = 6
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we add Sapphire. But if we add Sapphire, our total weight will come to 8.</p>
<p>In the fractional knapsack problem, we can cut items up to take fractions of them. We have a weight of 1 left in the bag. Our sapphire is weight 2. We calculate the ratio of:</p>
<p>$$\frac{weight;of;knapsack;left}{weight;of;item}$$</p>
<p>And then multiply this ratio by the value of the item to get how much value of that item we can take.</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{2} * 6 = 3$$</p>
<pre><code>knapsack value = 21
knapsack weight = 7
</code></pre>
<p>The greedy algorithm can optimally solve the fractional knapsack problem, but it cannot optimally solve the {0, 1} knapsack problem. In this problem instead of taking a fraction of an item, you either take it {1} or you don&rsquo;t {0}. To solve this, you need to use <a href="/dynamic-programming/">Dynamic Programming</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/you-need-to-understand-big-o-notation-now/">runtime </a>for this algorithm is O(n log n). Calculating $\frac{value}{weight}$ is O(1). Our main step is sorting from largest $\frac{value}{weight}$, which takes O(n log n) time.</p>
