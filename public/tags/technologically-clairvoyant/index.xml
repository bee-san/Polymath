      <description>Brazil has developed what is being called an “e-democracy” tool which allows anyone in the public to edit legislative texts and add suggestions.
The tool, called WikiLegis is an initiative by the House of Representatives and the creator is LabHacker which states
“to articulate a network among parliamentarians, hackers and civil society that contributes to the culture of transparency and social participation through the management of public data.” Currently it’s use is limited to two laws: the Access to Information Law (which is Brazil’s version of the Freedom of Information Act) and the Rules of Instruments for Public Efficiency.</description>

Near future 🖲 Nimses - Most Addictive Social Network
This social network pays you to use it. Every new post you create is more money for you.
The more engagement your post gets, the more money you make. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with Steemit before.
What differentiates it from Steemit is the idea that you can buy a property.</description>

      <description>Technical side of Libra Some things about this crypto:
 It is pseudo-anonymous (there is no identity on the blockchain) It&amp;rsquo;s permissioned (like hyper ledger)  Organisations will run nodes.
These nodes validate transactions.
Each time a consensus is voted on, a new leader will be designated at random to count up the votes.
Facebook says:
&amp;ldquo;Founding Members are organizations with established reputations, making it unlikely that they would act maliciously,&amp;rdquo;</description>
