      <description>Greedy Algorithms Greedy algorithms aim to make the optimal choice at that given moment. Each step it chooses the optimal choice, without knowing the future. It attempts to find the globally optimal way to solve the entire problem using this method.
Why Are Greedy Algorithms Called Greedy? Algorithms are called greedy when they utilise the greedy property. The greedy property is:
 At that exact moment in time, what is the optimal choice to make?</description>
