      <description>You want to do TryHackMe, but perhaps you do not want to pay for a subscription. This means you will not get access to paths, which are a guided series of rooms to take you from not knowing something to knowing something.
This blog post will detail a free path I have created for you, taking you from a beginner to a medium level. This blog post will stay continuously updated with new rooms as they come out and will improve with suggestions from the community.</description>
