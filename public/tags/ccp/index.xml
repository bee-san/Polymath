      <description>Authentication Comprised of 2 parts of information.
 Who you are?  Presenting your identity (login username). Unique value within the system we are trying to authenticate to.
Verify you are who you say you are. Passwords, MFA, etc. This does not have to be unique.  We may use credit card pin numbers for authentication. Identity = credit card, verify = pin number.
Authorisation Happens before authentication.
System in which we have authenticated to establishes what level of privileges we can access.</description>

With traditional backup methods, the data we need might not be available because:
 Backup data is stored in the same location as the production data, and the disaster impacted the backups. If using a tape backup method, the tapes could fail making the data unreadable. The tapes could get lost when in transit.</description>
