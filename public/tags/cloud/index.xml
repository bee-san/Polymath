      <description>Authentication Comprised of 2 parts of information.
 Who you are?  Presenting your identity (login username). Unique value within the system we are trying to authenticate to.
Verify you are who you say you are. Passwords, MFA, etc. This does not have to be unique.  We may use credit card pin numbers for authentication. Identity = credit card, verify = pin number.
Authorisation Happens before authentication.
System in which we have authenticated to establishes what level of privileges we can access.</description>

      <description>Blob storage Binary Large Object (Blob) storage is a way of storing large files.
There are 3 types of Blobs in Azure:
Blob Blocks Divided into blocks of up to 100MB in size. Blobs of up to 4.75TB can be stored as blob blocks in Azure.
Using multiple blocks to represent the blob allows for more efficient handling of large blobs. Usually, the complexity of managing individual blocks is handled for you so you can simply deal with the entire blob rather than individual blocks.</description>

      <title>Disaster Recovery with AWS for CCP</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll need to invoke our disaster recovery plans to restore our data if our storage or server fails.
With traditional backup methods, the data we need might not be available because:
 Backup data is stored in the same location as the production data, and the disaster impacted the backups. If using a tape backup method, the tapes could fail making the data unreadable. The tapes could get lost when in transit.</description>
