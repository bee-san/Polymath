I‚Äôve come up with a bullet pointed actionable list of how to make open source projects popular.\nOne of the projects I created had 67 lines of code and had only existed for 3 days before it hit 1.7k stars.\nHumans are predictable creatures when it comes to our attention. I‚Äôll show you data backed actionable insights that can help you create popular software.\nWhy Bother? Popular Projects = More Contributors = Better Project What‚Äôs the point in getting more GitHub stars? They mean nothing. You can‚Äôt buy a coffee with exposure. If GitHub dies, so do the stars.\nThe problem with open source is the network effect. The more people that find your project, the more people that use it, the more that contribute to it and thus the better it becomes.\nThe better the project, the more popular it becomes. It‚Äôs a self-fufilling cycle.\nAs this cycle continues, it becomes harder for it to continue. That‚Äôs a blog post for another day. But first, let‚Äôs talk about where we start.\nTo start us on this cycle we need popularity.\nTo get contributors to your project it has to be popular enough so people see it and contribute.\nCreating a popular open source project isn‚Äôt just a want but a need.\nIf a project has contributors but no popularity, it‚Äôs likely created by a company for internal use and was open sourced.\nOtherwise, only popular open source projects have contributors.\nWell Designed README README.md is the first thing anyone sees. Make sure to catch their eyes right away.\nIt‚Äôs harder to gain traction based purely on the merit of the tool rather than on the presentation of the tool.\nFor frontend applications you should focus more on the design of the frontend rather than the README. This is for CLI applicatiions.\nA well designed README answers these questions succintly:\n What does this do? Does it solve my problem? Does it solve my problem better than the competitors (if they exist) do? How do I install it? What are the basic commands I need to know? Where can I go for more help?  This is how a README answers these questions.\nWe‚Äôll go through each of these.\nCreate a Header Summarising Your Project The first thing they see is your README. The first thing they see on the README is the header. Make it good.\nThe header is the combination of:\n Logo. Slogan (short description). Badges. Quick Install. Quick Links (not always needed).  Beautiful Logo as simple as Canva.com The logo is the first thing a user sees, and is the image used for social media sharing. When I first create a project, I‚Äôll use something from Canva.\nCanva allows you to quickly create a logo from a template for free.\nGo to Canva and search for ‚ÄúLogo‚Äù\n{{ rawhtml }} {{ /rawhtml }}\n   And then just select one of the many logos you come across. Edit it if you want.\nTypically, there are 2 things I look for in a logo:\n Coolness factor üòé Slogan  I should look at the logo and think ‚Äùwow, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù.\n   It‚Äôs a gif! Isn‚Äôt that cool? I made it on Canva in about ~45 seconds. ~30 seconds were spent searching for it!\nSecondly, the slogan. The first thing people see will be the logo which contains the name and slogan, instantly they will know what the project is about.\nFor some of my larger projects I hire a designer, specifically Varg. Designers are great! Especially ones that can understand the project at hand, which aids creating a well-conceived logo.\nIn short: don‚Äôt spend too long picking a logo. If you‚Äôre not hiring a designer, perhaps ~5 minutes playing around on Canva.\nSlogan (description) of your project in 1 simple line\nWhen thinking about the design of your project, think about how people found it. There are 2 major ways people can find your project:\n Someone reccomends it to them. It‚Äôs posted on Twitter / HackerNews / LinkedIn / other social media or news aggregators.  When someone reccomends something it‚Äôs because that something solves their problem. This means that they already have an idea of how this project solves their problem, of what the project does.\nWhen posted, Twitter will make a social card for it. This card is the title, description, and an image:\n   Both of the main methods of sharing your project include a description already. This means 2 things:\n We don‚Äôt need to spend time describing what our project is in the README. GitHub‚Äôs Description will be used everywhere and is the first thing people see.     One sentence or two will be adequate to explain our project in the README.\nThis is why I include the quick install section in the README. Users who come to your project already have an idea of what it is. Since they do, provide a way for them to quickly install it and try it out for themselves.\n ‚ÄúTalk is cheap. Show me the code.‚Äù - Linus Torvalds\n Good descriptions are hard to write. Very hard.\nIt needs to:\n Describe the project. Be eye-catching. Show why the user needs it. Show why it‚Äôs better than the rest. Be easy enough for someone that only knows the subject matter in passing to understand.  This is copywriting. It‚Äôs an important skill to learn as copywriting is:\n Writing in such a way to convince someone to do something.\n My favourite resource is Brian Dean‚Äôs Copywriting Guide.\ngohugoio/hugo: The world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites. (github.com)\n The world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites.\n This explains what the project is well. It is:\n Succint. Answers the question ‚ÄúWhy are you better than the rest?‚Äù with ‚Äùworld‚Äôs fastest‚Äù. Answers what it does, ‚Äùframework for building websites.‚Äù Easy enough to understand for non-experts, ‚Äùbuilding websites‚Äù. Uses eye-catching words such as ‚Äùworlds largest‚Äù and its succintness implies ‚Äúwe can read this, it‚Äôll only take a second of our time to process this.‚Äù  You should spend a few weeks experimenting with the description on-and-off.\nCome up with many descriptions, about ~20. And continually improve upon it. When you lie down in bed, think ‚ÄùIf I had never seen my project before, what would I want to see to make me use it?‚Äù.\nThe description is the hardest, but most important part of the whole design. It‚Äôs the first thing people see. Invest time into this. Learn copywriting. Even when you think it‚Äôs perfect, it can always be improved.\nAsk your users what they think of it. Iterate until you can no longer iterate.\nBadges Badges are links / images that sum up the project.\n   They explain where to find documentation, is the current branch stable? How clean is the code?\n   How active is the project? How many downloads? The license? Any chatrooms? Mostly, badges are just cool stickers you can include. I like reading them, some people may not. You can find a list of badges on shields.io.\nQuick Installation guide The user understands what the application does from seeing it in the social cards or being told by a friend.\nSometimes, they want to install it as fast as possible to play around.\n ‚ÄúTalk is cheap, show me the code.‚Äù - Linus Torvalds\n The quick install guide allows users to install the software immeditadly.\n   üêç Python üêã Docker (Universal)         python3 -m pip install ciphey --upgrade docker run -it --rm remnux/ciphey    | Linux | Mac OS | Windows |\nUsers do not need to scour the README for information on installation if they are already knowledgeable and want to use the project.\nThe style above is clean. The package manager‚Äôs name, the logo of the operating system and a short installation to copy / paste.\nQuick Links This isn‚Äôt required in all READMEs.\nLinking to all the resources the user needs in one neat place allows the user to quickly understand anything they want.\nThe order of these matter. As the user reads left-to-right (assuming English README), the further away items are the less likely they will see it. You want them to see your Twitter first? Include that at the first item.\nWhile this is a flat list seperated by pipes, it is an ordered list in the sense that users will only read so far.\nI include my quicklinks at the top of the page, above the fold (the logo).\nThe user will already have a rough idea of what the project is. They may only want 3 things from the README:\n Documentation. Support (the Discord link). The Installation Guide.  By being at the top, we reduce the friction of finding them.\nExample Images to show off your project The header is also a great place to show how your project works. You can use gifs (discussed later in more depth) or images.\nThis depends on your project, but having images in your header may make sense.\nInspiration for designing your header Let‚Äôs look at some inspiration\nWhat Is This? Describing Your Project Succinctly. This section explains the features of your product.\nShort explanations. A gif that demonstrates your project. Essential features you think someone would want to see.\nLook at the Starship prompt.\nThey have a table with 2 columns but without borders. In the left column is the list of essential features. Each feature is bolded with a short explanation.\n Bold feature: I am explaining the feature  And in the right column is a gif showing how the program works, preferably detailing the features mentioned.\nTo create a gif of a CLI app, use Terminalizer. Clean up your terminal before you record, as it can look messy.\nWhen thinking of what features to show, do not show them all. Only show the features that the user wants to see. And in words that a user can understand.\nX vs Y, Comparisons With Competitors If your project is competing with a lot of other projects, you‚Äôre going to need to show the user exactly why they should use your project over the competitors.\nConvincing someone to leave their current tool for yours is hard. Make it as easy as possible for them to see the advantages over their current tooling.\nIn The Lean Startup the author talks about why in the beggining of a startup we should focus on the early adoptors over the average customers.\n ‚ÄúThe point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.‚Äù\n The early adoptors are those that wouldn‚Äôt mind switching out their current tooling for a less tested, less mainstream option if it means it has better functionality.\nThe only way to get the average customer to use your product is:\n No competitors must exist. Their current solution to the problem is extremely convuluted compared to yours.  Otherwise, your best bet is to appeal to the early adoptors and overtime slowly appeal to the average customer as your project becomes more mainstream.\nThe easiest way to compare your projects to others is to include a table of popular features. Use statistics here. It‚Äôs harder to believe words than it is numbers, even if the words are just as truthful as the numbers.\nFor Ciphey we compared our program to our largest possible competitor, CyberChef‚Äôs Magic function.\nYou can see we used gifs to demonstrate this. We explain how long each one takes and the setup of both, which can all be seen in the gifs.\nWe also leave footnotes on some things. Such as gifs loading at different times, the function (at the time) failing to decode.\nLater on, we compare again with a table this time of features.\nCreate Great Documentation Do not put all your documentation into your README because:\n It‚Äôs harder to update. It‚Äôs harder for users to find things. It makes the README unbearably long and ugly.  We don‚Äôt write all of our code in one file, why have all of our documentation in our README?\nDon‚Äôt make the documentation section long. Since we have already explained how to install quickly, we should show:\n How to run the program. How to find the documentation. How to find support.  I included a gif here showing all the different ways there are to run Ciphey. Gifs are magical and easy to make.\nContributing, Thanking \u0026 Welcoming Contributors The final section is about contributing.\n How to contribute. Thanking past contributors.  We need contributors to our project to fufil the cycle.\nTherefore, our README needs to clearly display how to contribute.\nA short paragraph describing how to contribute, where to ask for help if they are stuck, the contributing.md file and any potential rewards for contributing (name added to the README and the chance to work on a growing project).\nAnd then you want to thank your contributors. We use all-contributors which makes it easy to thank them. It shows their profile picture, a link to their websites along with emoji defining what they did.\nConclusion Design is subjective and you may like somethings, you may not. It‚Äôs down to you to decide on what looks good.\nI hope the design principles I shared, along with the READMEs included here will inspire you to create something beautiful.\nOne thing I didn‚Äôt talk about here is creating documentation. It is your job as a programmer to create documentation. Your project is not done until it has documentation. You can use GitHub Wiki and DocStrings to automatically generate some documentation (you‚Äôll still need to write documentatiion for installation, usage, etc).\nRemember ‚Äî the README is one of the most important parts of an open source project (along with the documentation).\nCreating Something People Want A good README will get people interested, a working project that solves their problems will get people talking.\nThis chapter is based on Zero to One by Peter Thiel, but will feature inspiration from other places.\n ‚ÄúEvery moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won‚Äôt make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won‚Äôt create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren‚Äôt learning from them.‚Äù\n Problem First, Product Second For your project to grow, it has to solve a problem. It‚Äôs better to find a solution to a problem that people have rather than creating a project for the sake of it.\nLet‚Äôs compare 2 ideas.\n A recipe app A digital platform for artists to share their work, get feedback and start selling to gallery owners.  The first one doesn‚Äôt solve any problems. There are millions of recipe apps in the world and unless there is something truly unique it won‚Äôt take off.\nThe second one is a unique \u0026 novel idea that aims to solve the problem of:\n ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an artisit wanting to get paid for my work and improve.‚Äù\n We have a problem, artists not getting paid, and we solve the problem.\nSome people come up with the project first, but doing this means:\n We aren‚Äôt solving one specific problem from the start. We don‚Äôt have a well-defined target market. It‚Äôs likely already been done before.  As Walter Isaacson said in The Innovators:\n ‚ÄúBut the main lesson to draw from the birth of computers is that innovation is usually a group effort, involving collaboration between visionaries and engineers, and that creativity comes from drawing on many sources. Only in storybooks do inventions come like a thunderbolt, or a lightbulb popping out of the head of a lone individual in a basement or garret or garage.‚Äù\n It‚Äôs unlikely for our project to be innoativie if we don‚Äôt solve a small problem first. In the same book, Isaacon says:\n ‚ÄúProgress comes not only in great leaps but also from hundreds of small steps.‚Äù\n Solving the problem will bring us closer to a unique \u0026 novel project.\nLiving With the Problem You cannot solve a problem you do not have. In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries states:\n ‚ÄúIn my Toyota interviews, when I asked what distinguishes the Toyota Way from other management approaches, the most common first response was genchi gembutsu‚Äîwhether I was in manufacturing, product development, sales, distribution, or public affairs. You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the reports of others.‚Äù\n Unless you have the problem, you cannot effectively solve the problem.\nIt also helps with idea generation. Pay attention to the minor inconviences in your life, in the lives of people around you and build products that solve those problems.\nIt‚Äôs a lot easier to observe the problems present in your own life than it is to generate random ideas that might work.\nIf you have the problem, you know 2 things:\n The problem exists. Other people have the problem.  The first point is important. Many people create solutions for problems that do not exist.\n  This product essentially injects the potato with oil and other foods. This problem does not exist. No one has ever had this problem. If you watch the video, you can see that the Potato Doctor actually cuts the potato open. What is the point? There isn‚Äôt one.\nThe second point is less obvious, but a good indicator. Humans are not entiely unique. We mostly share the same problems. If the problem directly affects my life, I know that it must affect other people too.\nFinding Problems in Communities You don‚Äôt have to be the one to find the problem, others can too. If you pay attention to a community, these people will reveal problems they are facing.\nListening to a community exponentially grows your rate of ideas vs being on your own.\nThe more people there are, the more you listen, the more ideas you can generate over time compared to thinking on your own.\nBuild a minimal viable product that solves the problem the community is facing.\n A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle.  Share with the community. Measure its effectitness, learn how to do better and re-build it (or add more) to improve upon it.\nOvertime, it will eventually leak out of the community into other similar communities.\nYou have around 2 weeks before you lose motivation to work on something. Create the smallest possible minimum viable product that the community can use. Their thanks, if provided, will give you the motivation to continue working on it.\nSolving the Problem Well Here‚Äôs the thing.\n You have a problem you can solved. You have a community that‚Äôll help you solve this problem and provides feedback.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean your problem is solved well. Take a look at Juicero. Juicero solved a problem that many people have.\nWe want to create our own juice drinks, but to do that we have to:\n Buy Fruit \u0026 Vegetables. Wash them. Cut them. Juice them. Clean up.  Juicero‚Äôs solution was to (ignoring hardware):\n Insert packet into Juicero to get juice.  This is a good idea, but it was poorly executed.\n  There are many talks about why Juicero failed ‚Äî all out of scope of this article.\nThe point is that you could have a great idea, but if it‚Äôs poorly executed it may have too many downsides to be used as the solution.\nThe way to solve this is via the minimum viable product loop. Instead of spending 3 years creating a project, we release as soon as possible, gather feedback, improve and loop.\nWe are continuously heading towards what people want, and each iteration will solve the problem better than the last. If it doesn‚Äôt, next iteration we solve the problem differently and so on.\nGetting the Word Out If we never show off our project, why would we expect anyone to see it? It‚Äôs not good enough to build it and hope they come. We have to get the word out.\nThe good news is that if you‚Äôve been following along in Creating Something People Want we already have the word out. The community we are in know about the project and use it.\nThat helps us immensely. Going from 10 GitHub stars to 100 is easy. Going from 0 to 1 is hard.\nOnce we get a few stars we will get more stars. Stars beget stars ‚≠ê.\nSharing With a Community If we have been following the Build, Measure, Learn loop and reguluarly publishing minimal viable products than we will already have the word out in our community.\nWhen it comes time to publish, make sure your community knows that it‚Äôs the first real release. They‚Äôd be more likely to share with their friends this way.\nNews Aggregators Your next port of call is news aggregators. These are places that collate news. You should post to:\n Subreddit of your choosing. HackerNews. Lobste.rs.  Do not read the comments. Those places are incredibly toxic and can‚Äôt see a good product even if it hit them in the face.\nAwesome Lists An Awesome list is a list of awesome things about some topic. There‚Äôs lists such as:\n Rust Python Hacking Web  And more.\nFind some lists that apply to you and submit PRs. In the worst case, they don‚Äôt accecpt it.\nGitHub Trending If all goes well, you should hit GitHub trending at some point. This will provide monumental traffic.\nOnce you hit trending, pay attention to social media and thank anyone that shares your project. If they follow you they may re-tweet your project again in the futurue.\nThis is the snowball effect. You need about ~50 stars to hit trending page for your language, ~100 stars to hit the overall trending. Once you do this, trending will give you more stars and it will continually snowball.\nLeverage an Existing Following or Past Popularity The easiest way to gain stars is by leveraging your own existing following. Post on social media, other GitHub repos and the likes.\nConclusion - Throw the Rule Book Away Like all things, this is not an exact science, more like art. And you can‚Äôt become good at art by following other peoples guidance. You‚Äôve got to discover your own unique style.\nThe Mona Lisa was painted once, but the thousands of people that painted the Mona Lisa afterwards were never recgonised.\nI suggest you throw some of the rules away, experiemnt yourself. Create new rules and understand what works for you.\nWhat works for me, won‚Äôt neccesarily work for you. So go ahead, throw the rule book away!\nLet‚Äôs go over some things we learnt.\n Well designed READMEs are essential. Creating something people want. Get the word out there. Discover your own unique style and what works for you.  ",

<p>I have around ~10k GitHub stars.  I‚Äôve come up with a bullet pointed actionable list of how to make open source projects popular.</p>
<p>One of the projects I created had 67 lines of code and had only existed for 3 days before it hit 1.7k stars.</p>
<p>Humans are predictable creatures when it comes to our attention. I‚Äôll show you data backed actionable insights that can help you create popular software.</p>
<h1 id="why-bother-popular-projects--more-contributors--better-project">Why Bother? Popular Projects = More Contributors = Better Project<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-bother-popular-projects--more-contributors--better-project">#</a></h1>
<p>What‚Äôs the point in getting more GitHub stars? They mean nothing. You can‚Äôt buy a coffee with exposure. If GitHub dies, so do the stars.</p>
<p>The problem with open source is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect.</a> The more people that find your project, the more people that use it, the more that contribute to it and thus the better it becomes.</p>
<p>The better the project, the more popular it becomes. It‚Äôs a self-fufilling cycle.</p>
<p><img src="/media/populaross/loop4.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>As this cycle continues, it becomes harder for it to continue. That‚Äôs a blog post for another day. But first, let‚Äôs talk about where we start.</p>
<p>To start us on this cycle we need popularity.</p>
<p>To get contributors to your project it has to be popular enough so people see it and contribute.</p>
<p>Creating a popular open source project isn‚Äôt just a want but a need.</p>
<p>If a project has contributors but no popularity, it‚Äôs likely created by a company for internal use and was open sourced.</p>
<p>Otherwise, only popular open source projects have contributors.</p>
<h1 id="well-designed-readme">Well Designed README<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#well-designed-readme">#</a></h1>
<p><code>README.md</code> is the first thing anyone sees. Make sure to catch their eyes right away.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs harder to gain traction based purely on the merit of the tool rather than on the presentation of the tool.</p>
<p>For frontend applications you should focus more on the design of the frontend rather than the <code>README</code>. This is for CLI applicatiions.</p>
<p>A well designed README answers these questions succintly:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does this do?</li>
<li>Does it solve my problem?</li>
<li>Does it solve my problem better than the competitors (if they exist) do?</li>
<li>How do I install it?</li>
<li>What are the basic commands I need to know?</li>
<li>Where can I go for more help?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how a <code>README</code> answers these questions.</p>
<p><img src="/media/populaross/Logo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We‚Äôll go through each of these.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-header-summarising-your-project">Create a Header Summarising Your Project<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-a-header-summarising-your-project">#</a></h2>
<p>The first thing they see is your <code>README</code>. The first thing they see on the <code>README</code> is the header. Make it good.</p>
<p>The header is the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo.</li>
<li>Slogan (short description).</li>
<li>Badges.</li>
<li>Quick Install.</li>
<li>Quick Links (not always needed).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beautiful Logo as simple as Canva.com</strong>
The logo is the first thing a user sees, and is the image used for social media sharing.
When I first create a project, I‚Äôll use something from <a href="https://canva.com">Canva</a>.</p>
<p>Canva allows you to <strong>quickly</strong> create a logo from a template for free.</p>
<p>Go to Canva and search for ‚ÄúLogo‚Äù</p>
<p>{{ rawhtml }}
<img src="/media/populaross/canvalogo.png">
{{ /rawhtml }}</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/canvalogo.png">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then just select one of the many logos you come across. Edit it if you want.</p>
<p>Typically, there are 2 things I look for in a logo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coolness factor üòé</li>
<li>Slogan</li>
</ul>
<p>I should look at the logo and think <em>‚Äùwow, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù</em>.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/hashsearch.gif">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It‚Äôs a gif! Isn‚Äôt that cool? I made it on Canva in about ~45 seconds. ~30 seconds were spent searching for it!</p>
<p>Secondly, the slogan. The first thing people see will be the logo which contains the name and slogan, instantly they will know what the project is about.</p>
<p>For some of my larger projects I hire a designer, specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/Vargnaar">Varg</a>. Designers are great! Especially ones that can understand the project at hand, which aids creating a well-conceived logo.</p>
<p>In short: don‚Äôt spend too long picking a logo. If you‚Äôre not hiring a designer, perhaps ~5 minutes playing around on Canva.</p>
<p><strong>Slogan (description) of your project in 1 simple line</strong></p>
<p>When thinking about the design of your project, think about <em>how</em> people found it. There are 2 major ways people can find your project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone reccomends it to them.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs posted on Twitter / HackerNews / LinkedIn / other social media or news aggregators.</li>
</ol>
<p>When someone reccomends something it‚Äôs because that something solves their problem. This means that they already have an idea of <em>how</em> this project solves their problem, of what the project does.</p>
<p>When posted, Twitter will make a social card for it. This card is the title, description, and an image:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/card.png">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both of the main methods of sharing your project include a description already. This means 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don‚Äôt need to spend time describing <em>what</em> our project is in the <code>README</code>.</li>
<li>GitHub‚Äôs Description will be used everywhere and is the first thing people see.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/githubdes.png">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One sentence or two will be adequate to explain our project in the <code>README</code>.</p>
<p>This is why I include the <em>quick install</em> section in the <code>README</code>. Users who come to your project already have an idea of what it is. Since they do, provide a way for them to quickly install it and try it out for themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúTalk is cheap. Show me the code.‚Äù - Linus Torvalds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good descriptions are hard to write. Very hard.</p>
<p>It needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the project.</li>
<li>Be eye-catching.</li>
<li>Show why the user needs it.</li>
<li>Show why it‚Äôs better than the rest.</li>
<li>Be easy enough for someone that only knows the subject matter in passing to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is copywriting. It‚Äôs an important skill to learn as copywriting is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing in such a way to convince someone to do something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My favourite resource is <a href="https://backlinko.com/copywriting-guide">Brian Dean‚Äôs Copywriting Guide</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">gohugoio/hugo: The world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites. (github.com)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world‚Äôs fastest framework for building websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains what the project is well. It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Succint.</li>
<li>Answers the question ‚ÄúWhy are you better than the rest?‚Äù with <em>‚Äùworld‚Äôs fastest‚Äù</em>.</li>
<li>Answers what it does, <em>‚Äùframework for building websites.‚Äù</em></li>
<li>Easy enough to understand for non-experts, <em>‚Äùbuilding websites‚Äù</em>.</li>
<li>Uses eye-catching words such as <em>‚Äùworlds largest‚Äù</em> and its succintness implies ‚Äúwe can read this, it‚Äôll only take a second of our time to process this.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>You should spend a few weeks experimenting with the description on-and-off.</p>
<p>Come up with many descriptions, about ~20. And continually improve upon it. When you lie down in bed, think <em>‚ÄùIf I had never seen my project before, what would I want to see to make me use it?‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>The description is the hardest, but most important part of the whole design. <strong>It‚Äôs the first thing people see.</strong> Invest time into this. Learn copywriting. Even when you think it‚Äôs perfect, it can always be improved.</p>
<p>Ask your users what they think of it. Iterate until you can no longer iterate.</p>
<p><strong>Badges</strong>
Badges are links / images that sum up the project.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/badges1.png">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They explain where to find documentation, is the current branch stable? How clean is the code?</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/media/populaross/badges2.png">
	<figcaption><figcaption>
</figure>
<p>How active is the project? How many downloads? The license? Any chatrooms?
Mostly, badges are just cool stickers you can include. I like reading them, some people may not.
You can find a list of badges on <a href="http://shields.io/">shields.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Installation guide</strong>
The user understands what the application does from seeing it in the social cards or being told by a friend.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they want to install it as fast as possible to play around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúTalk is cheap, show me the code.‚Äù - Linus Torvalds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quick install guide allows users to install the software immeditadly.</p>

<p>Users do not need to scour the <code>README</code> for information on installation if they are already knowledgeable and want to use the project.</p>
<p>The style above is clean. The package manager‚Äôs name, the logo of the operating system and a short installation to copy / paste.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607385490951_image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Quick Links</strong>
This isn‚Äôt required in all READMEs.</p>
<p>Linking to all the resources the user needs in one neat place allows the user to quickly understand <em>anything</em> they want.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607385549430_image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The order of these matter. As the user reads left-to-right (assuming English <code>README</code>), the further away items are the less likely they will see it. You want them to see your Twitter first? Include that at the first item.</p>
<p>While this is a flat list seperated by pipes, it is an ordered list in the sense that users will only read so far.</p>
<p>I include my quicklinks at the top of the page, above the fold (the logo).</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607385675134_image.png" alt="My operating system does not support flag emojis, sorry it looks horrible."></p>
<p>The user will already have a rough idea of what the project is. They may only want 3 things from the README:</p>
<ol>
<li>Documentation.</li>
<li>Support (the Discord link).</li>
<li>The Installation Guide.</li>
</ol>
<p>By being at the top, we reduce the friction of finding them.</p>
<p><strong>Example Images to show off your project</strong>
The header is also a great place to show <em>how</em> your project works. You can use gifs (discussed later in more depth) or images.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607385985741_image.png" alt="microsoft/Bringing-Old-Photos-Back-to-Life: Bringing Old Photo Back to Life (CVPR 2020 oral) (github.com)"></p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607386176333_image.png" alt="User-uploaded image: image.png"></p>
<p>They have a table with 2 columns but without borders. In the left column is the list of essential features. Each feature is bolded with a short explanation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold feature</strong>: I am explaining the feature</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the right column is a gif showing how the program works, preferably detailing the features mentioned.</p>
<p>To create a gif of a CLI app, use <a href="https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer">Terminalizer</a>. Clean up your terminal before you record, as it can look messy.</p>
<p>When thinking of what features to show, <strong>do not show them all.</strong> Only show the features that the user wants to see. And in words that a user can understand.</p>
<h2 id="x-vs-y-comparisons-with-competitors">X vs Y, Comparisons With Competitors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#x-vs-y-comparisons-with-competitors">#</a></h2>
<p>If your project is competing with a lot of other projects, you‚Äôre going to need to show the user exactly why they should use your project over the competitors.</p>
<p>Convincing someone to leave their current tool for yours is hard. Make it as easy as possible for them to see the advantages over their current tooling.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=zKpCYP3FEY&amp;rank=1">The Lean Startup</a> the author talks about why in the beggining of a startup we should focus on the early adoptors over the average customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The point is not to find the average customer but to find <strong>early adopters</strong>: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The early adoptors are those that wouldn‚Äôt mind switching out their current tooling for a less tested, less mainstream option if it means it has better functionality.</p>
<p>The only way to get the average customer to use your product is:</p>
<ul>
<li>No competitors must exist.</li>
<li>Their current solution to the problem is extremely convuluted compared to yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, your best bet is to appeal to the early adoptors and overtime slowly appeal to the average customer as your project becomes more mainstream.</p>
<p>The easiest way to compare your projects to others is to include a table of popular features. Use statistics here. It‚Äôs harder to believe words than it is numbers, even if the words are just as truthful as the numbers.</p>
<p>For Ciphey we compared our program to our largest possible competitor, CyberChef‚Äôs Magic function.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607471669527_image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see we used gifs to demonstrate this. We explain how long each one takes and the setup of both, which can all be seen in the gifs.</p>
<p>We also leave footnotes on some things. Such as gifs loading at different times, the function (at the time) failing to decode.</p>
<p>Later on, we compare again with a table this time of features.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607471747425_image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="create-great-documentation">Create Great Documentation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-great-documentation">#</a></h2>
<p>Do not put all your documentation into your <code>README</code>  because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs harder to update.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs harder for users to find things.</li>
<li>It makes the <code>README</code> unbearably long and ugly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don‚Äôt write all of our code in one file, why have all of our documentation in our README?</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt make the documentation section long. Since we have already explained how to install quickly, we should show:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to run the program.</li>
<li>How to find the documentation.</li>
<li>How to find support.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607473358348_image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I included a gif here showing all the different ways there are to run Ciphey. Gifs are magical and easy to make.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-thanking--welcoming-contributors">Contributing, Thanking &amp; Welcoming Contributors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#contributing-thanking--welcoming-contributors">#</a></h2>
<p>The final section is about contributing.</p>
<ol>
<li>How to contribute.</li>
<li>Thanking past contributors.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need contributors to our project to fufil the cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607364723891_Untitled+Diagram.png" alt="User-uploaded image: Untitled+Diagram.png"></p>
<p>Therefore, our README needs to clearly display how to contribute.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607516180695_image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A short paragraph describing how to contribute, where to ask for help if they are stuck, the <code>contributing.md</code> file and any potential rewards for contributing (name added to the <code>README</code> and the chance to work on a growing project).</p>
<p>And then you want to thank your contributors. We use <a href="https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors">all-contributors</a> which makes it easy to thank them. It shows their profile picture, a link to their websites along with emoji defining <em>what</em> they did.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607516248961_image.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Design is subjective and you may like somethings, you may not. It‚Äôs down to you to decide on what looks good.</p>
<p>I hope the design principles I shared, along with the <code>README</code>s included here will inspire you to create something beautiful.</p>
<p>One thing I didn‚Äôt talk about here is creating documentation. It is your job as a programmer to create documentation. Your project is not done until it has documentation. You can use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis">GitHub Wiki</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">DocStrings</a> to automatically generate <em>some</em> documentation (you‚Äôll still need to write documentatiion for installation, usage, etc).</p>
<p>Remember ‚Äî the <code>README</code> is one of the most important parts of an open source project (along with the documentation).</p>
<h1 id="creating-something-people-want">Creating Something People Want<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-something-people-want">#</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9B9F4F79CD68B8F2BBFA967225D5A020CED0FE44C8FF677E9B45A1A25553A401_1607517029107_undraw_Gift_box_re_vau4.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>A good <code>README</code> will get people interested, a working project that solves their problems will get people talking.</p>
<p>This chapter is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">Zero to One by Peter Thiel</a>, but will feature inspiration from other places.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEvery moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won‚Äôt make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won‚Äôt create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren‚Äôt learning from them.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="problem-first-product-second">Problem First, Product Second<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#problem-first-product-second">#</a></h2>
<p>For your project to grow, it has to solve a problem. It‚Äôs better to find a solution to a problem that people have rather than creating a project for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs compare 2 ideas.</p>
<ol>
<li>A recipe app</li>
<li>A digital platform for artists to share their work, get feedback and start selling to gallery owners.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one doesn‚Äôt solve any problems. There are millions of recipe apps in the world and unless there is something <strong>truly</strong> unique it won‚Äôt take off.</p>
<p>The second one is a unique &amp; novel idea that aims to solve the problem of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm an artisit wanting to get paid for my work and improve.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a problem, artists not getting paid, and we solve the problem.</p>
<p>Some people come up with the project first, but doing this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>We aren‚Äôt solving one specific problem from the start.</li>
<li>We don‚Äôt have a well-defined target market.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs likely already been done before.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Walter Isaacson said in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21856367-the-innovators">The Innovators:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBut the main lesson to draw from the birth of computers is that innovation is usually a group effort, involving collaboration between visionaries and engineers, and that creativity comes from drawing on many sources. Only in storybooks do inventions come like a thunderbolt, or a lightbulb popping out of the head of a lone individual in a basement or garret or garage.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs unlikely for our project to be innoativie if we don‚Äôt solve a small problem first. In the same book, Isaacon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúProgress comes not only in great leaps but also from hundreds of small steps.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solving the problem will bring us closer to a unique &amp; novel project.</p>
<h2 id="living-with-the-problem">Living With the Problem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#living-with-the-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>You cannot solve a problem you do not have. In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup">The Lean Startup</a>, Eric Ries states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn my Toyota interviews, when I asked what distinguishes the Toyota Way from other management approaches, the most common first response was genchi gembutsu‚Äîwhether I was in manufacturing, product development, sales, distribution, or public affairs. <strong>You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand</strong>. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the reports of others.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you have the problem, you cannot effectively solve the problem.</p>
<p>It also helps with idea generation. Pay attention to the minor inconviences in your life, in the lives of people around you and build products that solve those problems.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a lot easier to observe the problems present in your own life than it is to generate random ideas that might work.</p>
<p>If you have the problem, you know 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem exists.</li>
<li>Other people have the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point is important. <strong>Many people create solutions for problems that do not exist.</strong></p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LqTdoN4y36U" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This product essentially injects the potato with oil and other foods. This problem does not exist. No one has ever had this problem. If you watch the video, you can see that the Potato Doctor actually cuts the potato open. What is the point? There isn‚Äôt one.</p>
<p>The second point is less obvious, but a good indicator. Humans are not entiely unique. We mostly share the same problems.  If the problem directly affects my life, I know that it must affect other people too.</p>
<h2 id="finding-problems-in-communities">Finding Problems in Communities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-problems-in-communities">#</a></h2>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to be the one to find the problem, others can too. If you pay attention to a community, these people will reveal problems they are facing.</p>
<p>Listening to a community exponentially grows your rate of ideas vs being on your own.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blog.ucsusa.org/wp-content/uploads/Exponential-vs.-linear-growth-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The more people there are, the more you listen, the more ideas you can generate over time compared to thinking on your own.</p>
<p>Build a minimal viable product that solves the problem the community is facing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>minimum viable product</strong>, or <strong>MVP</strong>, is a <strong>product</strong> with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a <strong>product</strong> idea early in the <strong>product</strong> development cycle.
<img src="https://www.startupcommons.org/uploads/2/1/0/9/21090978/1459367_orig.jpg" alt="Minimum Viable Products ‚Äî Defined by The Experts - Startup Commons"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Share with the community. Measure its effectitness, learn how to do better and re-build it (or add more) to improve upon it.</p>
<p>Overtime, it will eventually leak out of the community into other similar communities.</p>
<p>You have around 2 weeks before you lose motivation to work on something. Create the smallest possible minimum viable product that the community can use. Their thanks, if provided, will give you the motivation to continue working on it.</p>
<h2 id="solving-the-problem-well">Solving the Problem Well<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solving-the-problem-well">#</a></h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs the thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a problem you can solved.</li>
<li>You have a community that‚Äôll help you solve this problem and provides feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that doesn‚Äôt mean your problem is solved <em>well</em>. Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicero">Juicero</a>. Juicero solved a problem that many people have.</p>
<p>We want to create our own juice drinks, but to do that we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy Fruit &amp; Vegetables.</li>
<li>Wash them.</li>
<li>Cut them.</li>
<li>Juice them.</li>
<li>Clean up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Juicero‚Äôs solution was to (ignoring hardware):</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert packet into Juicero to get juice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good idea, but it was poorly executed.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlfAHrpm3C8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>There are many talks about why Juicero failed ‚Äî all out of scope of this article.</p>
<p>The point is that you could have a great idea, but if it‚Äôs poorly executed it may have too many downsides to be used as the solution.</p>
<p>The way to solve this is via the minimum viable product loop. Instead of spending 3 years creating a project, we release as soon as possible, gather feedback, improve and loop.</p>
<p>We are continuously heading towards what people want, and each iteration will solve the problem better than the last. If it doesn‚Äôt, next iteration we solve the problem differently and so on.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-word-out">Getting the Word Out<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-the-word-out">#</a></h1>
<p>If we never show off our project, why would we expect anyone to see it? It‚Äôs not good enough to build it and hope they come. We have to get the word out.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you‚Äôve been following along in Creating Something People Want we already have the word out. The community we are in know about the project and use it.</p>
<p>That helps us immensely. Going from 10 GitHub stars to 100 is easy. Going from 0 to 1 is hard.</p>
<p>Once we get a few stars we will get more stars. Stars beget stars ‚≠ê.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-with-a-community">Sharing With a Community<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sharing-with-a-community">#</a></h2>
<p>If we have been following the Build, Measure, Learn loop and reguluarly publishing minimal viable products than we will already have the word out in our community.</p>
<p>When it comes time to publish, make sure your community knows that it‚Äôs the first <strong>real</strong> release. They‚Äôd be more likely to share with their friends this way.</p>
<h2 id="news-aggregators">News Aggregators<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#news-aggregators">#</a></h2>
<p>Your next port of call is news aggregators. These are places that collate news. You should post to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subreddit of your choosing.</li>
<li>HackerNews.</li>
<li>Lobste.rs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not read the comments. Those places are incredibly toxic and can‚Äôt see a good product even if it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863">hit them in the face</a>.</p>
<h2 id="awesome-lists">Awesome Lists<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#awesome-lists">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://project-awesome.org/images/logo.png" alt="Curated list of awesome lists | Project-Awesome.org"></p>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome list</a> is a list of awesome things about some topic. There‚Äôs lists such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Hacking</li>
<li>Web</li>
</ul>
<p>And more.</p>
<p>Find some lists that apply to you and submit PRs. In the worst case, they don‚Äôt accecpt it.</p>
<h2 id="github-trending">GitHub Trending<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#github-trending">#</a></h2>
<p>If all goes well, you should hit GitHub trending at some point. This will provide monumental traffic.</p>
<p>Once you hit trending, pay attention to social media and thank anyone that shares your project. If they follow you they may re-tweet your project again in the futurue.</p>
<p>This is the snowball effect. You need about ~50 stars to hit trending page for your language, ~100 stars to hit the overall trending. Once you do this, trending will give you more stars and it will continually snowball.</p>
<h2 id="leverage-an-existing-following-or-past-popularity">Leverage an Existing Following or Past Popularity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#leverage-an-existing-following-or-past-popularity">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to gain stars is by leveraging your own existing following. Post on social media, other GitHub repos and the likes.</p>

<p>Like all things, this is not an exact science, more like art. And you can‚Äôt become good at art by following other peoples guidance. You‚Äôve got to discover your own unique style.</p>
<p>The Mona Lisa was painted once, but the thousands of people that painted the Mona Lisa afterwards were never recgonised.</p>
<p>I suggest you throw some of the rules away, experiemnt yourself. Create new rules and understand what works for you.</p>
<p>What works for me, won‚Äôt neccesarily work for you. So go ahead, throw the rule book away!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs go over some things we learnt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well designed READMEs are essential.</li>
<li>Creating something people want.</li>
<li>Get the word out there.</li>
<li>Discover your own unique style and what works for you.</li>
